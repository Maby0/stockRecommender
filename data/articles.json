The news sent Twitter's shares up more than 3% on Tuesday morning. \"\"Through conversations with Elon in recent weeks, it became clear to us that he would bring great value to our Board,\"\" CEO Parag Agrawal said in a tweet Tuesday. \"\"He's both a passionate believer and intense critic of the service which is exactly what we need on Twitter, and in the boardroom, to make us stronger in the long-term,\"\" Agrawal added. Former chief Jack Dorsey praised the move , saying in a tweet that Musk \"\"cares deeply about our world and Twitter's role in it.\"\" Musk's term is set to expire in 2024, according to a filing with the SEC . For his entire board term or 90 days after, Musk cannot be the beneficial owner of more than 14.9% of the company's common stock outstanding. VIDEO 4:06 04:06 Tesla CEO Elon Musk to join Twitter board of directors Squawk Box Musk's purchase comes after a bout of criticism aimed at the social media company. The outspoken Tesla CEO polled people on Twitter last month about whether it adheres to free speech principles. He later said he was considering building a new social media platform. After he was named to the board, Musk on Tuesday teased he would push for adjustments to the product. \"\"Looking forward to working with Parag &amp; Twitter board to make significant improvements to Twitter in coming months!\"\" Musk said in a tweet. Musk's stake, while the largest among outside shareholders, is considered a passive interest, which often means the holder isn't trying to control or influence the company. Still, some investors expected Musk to take an aggressive stance . After the stake was revealed Monday, investors pushed the stock up 27%, its best day since its IPO . Hours after his holding in the company was revealed, Musk took to Twitter to poll users on interest in an edit button. Agrawal retweeted the post, urging people to \"\"vote carefully\"\" as the consequences \"\"will be important.\"\" Musk's investment comes at a key time for the social media company. Agrawal, who took over from Dorsey in November , has said he would focus on metrics and accelerate Twitter's work to bring new products to customers. He's also under pressure to reach the company's aggressive internal goals, including growing Twitter to 315 million monetizable daily active users by the end of 2023. Twitter reported 217 million monetizable daily active users for its most recent quarter . \"\"We believe Musk joining Twitter will lead to a host of strategic initiatives which could include a range of near-term and long-term possibilities out of the gates for the company still struggling in a social media arms race,\"\" Wedbush analyst Dan Ives said in a note to investors. It's \"\"time to get out the popcorn and watch the developments over the coming months with Musk on the Board,\"\" he said. Musk is an avid Twitter user with more than 80.5 million followers on the platform. However, he's also landed himself in hot water several times over his tweets. In 2018, Musk tweeted he had \"\"funding secured\"\" to take Tesla private at $420 per share, which led to litigation. Musk has since\u00a0 agreed to submit \u00a0his public statements about Tesla's finances and other topics to vetting by its legal counsel.\u00a0 He was also subpoenaed by the SEC in November after he asked his Twitter followers if he should sell 10% of his Tesla stock, causing\u00a0 the shares to fall .

The project will utilize GM's next-generation Ultium battery technology. The tie-up is expected to produce millions of lower-priced EVs, including popular compact crossover vehicles, beginning in 2027, according to officials. \"\"GM and Honda will share our best technology, design and manufacturing strategies to deliver affordable and desirable EVs on a global scale, including our key markets in North America, South America and China,\"\" GM Chair and CEO Mary Barra said in a statement. More affordable EVs are crucial to the mass adoption of the emerging technologies. While EVs are growing in popularity, they're largely priced for luxury buyers. The GM-Honda developed vehicles are expected to be priced below $30,000, Ken Morris, GM's executive vice president of electric, autonomous and fuel cell programs, told reporters during a call Tuesday morning.

GM plans to be capable of producing and selling about 2 million EVs globally by 2025. Honda, a leader in fuel efficient vehicles, has largely focused on hybrid vehicles but is pivoting to offer more all-electric models. The new partnership deepens the ties between the two companies regarding all-electric and autonomous vehicles. Honda previously invested $750 million in Cruise , GM's majority-owned autonomous vehicle unit, and GM produced two EVs for Honda for the 2024 model-year. The companies have also collaborated on battery modules and fuel cell vehicles. Honda still plans to develop its own EV technology and to start building its own electric vehicles after the two GM-made EVs go on sale in 2024, Rick Schostek, American Honda executive vice president of corporate operations, told reporters.

KIRILL Kudryavtsev | AFP | Getty Images The Russian economy is set to shrink sharply this year while inflation skyrockets, as punitive international sanctions in response to its unprovoked invasion of Ukraine begin to bite. Russian manufacturing activity in March contracted at its sharpest rate since May 2020, in the early stages of the Covid-19 pandemic, as material shortages and delivery delays weighed heavily on factories. The S&amp;P Global purchasing managers' index (PMI) for Russia, published on Friday, dropped from 48.6 in February to 44.1 in March, with anything below 50 representing contraction. Goldman Sachs economists noted on Friday that the fall was \"\"broad-based, with sharp drops in the output, new orders, and (especially) the new exports orders components.\"\" In a note Wednesday, economists at Capital Economics projected that Western sanctions are likely to push Russian gross domestic product into a 12% contraction in 2022, while inflation is expected to exceed 23% year-on-year. The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development has projected a 10% shrinkage in the Russian economy, which would still constitute the country's deepest recession for almost 30 years, with GDP then flatlining in 2023 and entering a prolonged period of negligible growth. Goldman Sachs has also forecast a 10% contraction, while the Institute for International Finance think tank has projected a more damaging 15% plunge in Russian GDP in 2022 and a further 3% in 2023. VIDEO 2:14 02:14 Putin's bet is that Europe will come back to the table with Russia: Professor Capital Connection Fears of a Russian sovereign debt default have not materialized, however, with the Kremlin managing to service a recent closely-watched bond payment despite the shackles of sanctions by Western powers that have frozen huge portions of the central bank's $640 billion stockpile of foreign currency reserves. Russian stocks have also edged higher since reopening on Mar. 24 after a month-long shutdown of Moscow exchanges, along with the ruble , though capital control measures taken by the Central Bank of Russia and the fading risk of debt default are partially responsible. \"\"A more sustained recovery will probably require a peace deal which still looks far away. Meanwhile, spillovers from the war will be felt acutely in Central and Eastern Europe (CEE),\"\" Capital Economics Chief Emerging Markets Economist William Jackson said in the report. \"\"Industry will be hit by supply disruptions and higher inflation will weigh on households' real incomes and dampen consumer spending. We expect the war to shave 1.0-1.5%-pts off growth in CEE this year.\"\" The outlook for Russia may yet darken further following the emergence over the weekend of allegations of civilian massacres by Russian forces in Bucha and other Ukrainian towns. The alleged atrocities will push back expectations for peace talks and increase the threat of more punitive international sanctions. Ukraine's top prosecutor said on Sunday that 410 bodies had been found in towns recaptured from retreating Russian forces around Kyiv as part of an investigation into possible war crimes, while Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy accused Russia of genocide. Russia has denied allegations that its forces killed civilians in Bucha, 23 miles northwest of Kyiv.

Despite the sharp declines in Russia's March PMIs, Goldman Sachs noted on Friday that activity across some CEEMEA economies was surprisingly robust, with gains in Hungary and South Africa offset by declines in Poland and the Czech Republic. \"\"Hungary's PMI has been relatively volatile in recent months, so we would downplay the significance of its gain (not least because our analysis suggests that it is relatively exposed to the Russia-Ukraine conflict),\"\" Goldman economists wrote. \"\"For South Africa, its direct trade with Russia and Ukraine is limited, while it is benefiting from higher commodity prices.\"\" VIDEO 7:18 07:18 How NATO is defending Eastern Europe CNBC Reports ", "polarity": 0.054502164502164496, "subjectivity": 0.27641991341991334}, {"id": 107041992, "datePublished": "2022-04-05T14:32:17+0000", "url": "https://www.cnbc.com/2022/04/05/feds-brainard-sees-balance-sheet-reduction-soon-and-at-a-rapid-pace.html", "articleText": "Lael Brainard, Federal Reserve governor and President Bidens nominee to be the new vice-chair of the Federal Reserve, speaks during her nomination hearing with the Senate Banking Committee on Capitol Hill January 13, 2022 in Washington, DC. Drew Angerer | Getty Images Federal Reserve Governor Lael Brainard, who normally favors loose policy and low rates, said Tuesday that the central bank needs to act quickly and aggressively to drive down inflation. In a speech for a Minneapolis Fed discussion, Brainard said that policy tightening will include a speedy reduction in the balance sheet and a steady pace of interest rate increases. Her comments indicated that rate moves could be higher than the traditional 0.25 percentage point moves. \"\"Currently, inflation is much too high and is subject to upside risks,\"\" she said in prepared remarks. \"\"The Committee is prepared to take stronger action if indicators of inflation and inflation expectations indicate that such action is warranted.\"\" The Fed already has approved one interest rate increase: a 0.25% hike at the March meeting that was the first in more than three years and likely one of many this year. In addition, markets expect the Fed to lay out a plan at its May meeting for running down some of the nearly $9 trillion in assets, primarily Treasurys and mortgage-backed securities, on its balance sheet. According to Brainard's Tuesday comments, that process will be swift. \"\"The Committee will continue tightening monetary policy methodically through a series of interest rate increases and by starting to reduce the balance sheet at a rapid pace as soon as our May meeting,\"\" she said. \"\"Given that the recovery has been considerably stronger and faster than in the previous cycle, I expect the balance sheet to shrink considerably more rapidly than in the previous recovery, with significantly larger caps and a much shorter period to phase in the maximum caps compared with 2017\u201319.\"\" Back then, the Fed allowed $50 billion in proceeds to roll off each month from maturing bonds and reinvested the rest. Market expectations are that the pace could double this time around. The moves are in response to inflation running at its fastest pace in 40 years, well above the Fed's 2% target. Market expectations are for rate increases at each of the remaining six meetings this year, possibly totaling 2.5 percentage points.

As the West enters its third year of drought, water sources are drying up , and restrictions on the Colorado River are now hitting all sectors of the Western economy, inculding homebuilding. While there is a shortage of water, there is also a shortage of housing. The US currently needs over a million more homes just to meet the current demand, according to an estimate by the National Association of Home Builders. Other estimates are even higher. As the millennial generation hits its prime homebuying years and Gen Z enters the fray, the supply of homes for sale is at a record low. Builders are hampered by high costs for land, labor and materials, so they are focused on the West and areas like the suburbs of Phoenix, Arizona, which are growing rapidly. \u00a0On a vast swath of land in Buckeye, Arizona, just west of Phoenix, the Howard Hughes Corporation is developing one of the largest master-planned communities in the nation, Douglas Ranch , flooding the desert with housing. Howard Hughes CEO David O'Reilly says water will not be a problem. \u00a0\"\"Every home will have low flow fixtures, national desert landscaping, drip irrigation and reclamation,\"\" he said, adding, \"\"we work with the local municipalities, the city of Buckeye, all the water districts, to make sure that we're enacting real conservation measures, not just at our property, but across the entire region.\"\" The community is projected to have more than a 100,000 homes, bringing in at least 300,000 new residents. Big public builders like Pulte , Taylor Morrison , Lennar , DR Horton and Toll Brothers have already expressed interest in building the homes, according to the Howard Hughes Corporation. And it's just one of more than two dozen developments in the works around Phoenix, all as the West is in the midst of its worst drought in more than 1,000 years . \"\"They're expecting the growth in this area to be a million people. And there isn't the water to sustain that growth. Not with groundwater,\"\" said Kathleen Ferris, Senior Water Research Fellow at Arizona State University. Ferris produced a documentary about the state's 1980 Groundwater Management Act. It requires developers to prove there is a hundred years-worth of water in the ground on which they're building. Douglas Ranch sits on the Hassayampa Aquifer, which will be its primary source of water. \u00a0\"\"And the problem is that with climate change there aren't backup water supplies that you can use to save a development that's based totally on groundwater. If it loses all of its water supply, there's no water to back that up,\"\" said Ferris. \u00a0Mark Stapp is director of Arizona State University's real estate development program at the W.P. Carey School of Business. He points to various reservoirs that could replenish the groundwater, but admits there is still risk due to the sheer scale of development. \u00a0\"\"I would say that there's a legitimate concern about our future, and policy-makers are very aware of this,\"\" said Stapp. \u00a0O'Reilly argues that the current need for housing surpasses future concerns that could be unfounded. \u00a0\"\"I don't think the answer is to tell people that are looking for an affordable home in Arizona, 'You can't live here, go somewhere else.' I think the responsible answer, the thoughtful answer, is to build them affordable homes, but to build it in a self-sustaining manner,\"\" O'Reilly said. A report last spring from ASU's Kyle Center for Water Policy warned the amount of groundwater in the Hassayampa subbasin is considerably less than regulators estimate, and that without a change in direction, \"\" the physical groundwater supply under Buckeye will decrease and will not be sustainable.\"\" The report also says that hundred-year model for groundwater is constantly changing, especially given the changing climate. The state's department of water resources is now in the process of determining if the basin does in fact have a hundred years' worth of water. \"\"The bottom line is that there are places in this state, in this valley where there are sufficient water supplies to support new growth. We don't need to go way out in the desert and pump groundwater to build new homes,\"\" said Ferris. The land, of course, is cheaper out in the desert, but Ferris argues, \"\"Well, at some point there's a cost to that.\"\" \u00a0 \u00a0 ", "polarity": 0.0832757575757576, "subjectivity": 0.3873743145743145}, {"id": 107041073, "datePublished": "2022-04-05T15:37:52+0000", "url": "https://www.cnbc.com/2022/04/05/bitcoin-powers-a-fast-new-way-to-send-us-dollars-around-the-world.html", "articleText": "A visual representation of Bitcoin cryptocurrency. Edward Smith | Getty Images There's a new and low-cost way to quickly send U.S. digital dollars around the world without a bank. And it's built on bitcoin. Blockchain start-up Lightning Labs announced Tuesday that it's launching the Taro protocol, a technology that will route fiat-pegged stablecoins and other digital assets through the bitcoin monetary network. The project is still in development mode. Taro uses Lightning, a payments platform built on top of bitcoin's base layer that enables global, high volume, virtually instantaneous, and low-fee transactions using the security of the bitcoin blockchain. \"\"It's one of those things where people don't really know how the credit card system works \u2013 and it just works,\"\" Lightning Labs CEO Elizabeth Stark told CNBC. Typically, this 'layer two' payments platform is all about making bitcoin easier to spend and receive \u2013 but Lightning Labs has decided to extend the use case of this tech to other types of virtual cash. \"\"With this technology, you could route all the world's currencies through bitcoin,\"\" said Stark. \"\"People will be able to seamlessly go between bitcoin and say, a USD stablecoin, or peso, euro, yen, etc. And they can send those globally, instantly and with extremely low fees,\"\" she said. How it works There is bitcoin, the asset class, and then there's the global interoperable bitcoin monetary network. Lightning Labs is piggybacking off the latter. You can think of Taro's payment workflow as enabling bitcoin to serve as a hybrid of the SWIFT financial messaging system (the communication layer) and correspondent banking (routing component). Typically, all nodes must agree to confirm a transaction on the bitcoin network, verifying every transaction on the blockchain. The process highlights one of bitcoin's greatest strengths: its high degree of network decentralization, which is a big part of what ensures its security. But it is also relatively slow, averaging five transactions per second on bitcoin's base layer, and can be expensive. On the Lightning Network, not all participants in the network need to agree. Instead, nodes only verify transactions with which they are directly interacting. That difference is key. Stark tells CNBC that it's possible to execute hundreds of thousands of transactions per second on Lightning. And then there's the cost. \"\"Lightning transactions can be fractions of a penny...while a bitcoin transaction at the core protocol layer can be much more expensive than that,\"\" said Alyse Killeen, founder and managing partner of bitcoin-focused venture firm Stillmark. Twitter integrated Lightning tipping in 2021 and the technology is already deployed around the world in places like El Salvador, which made bitcoin legal tender in Sept. 2021. But Lightning Labs says that the Taro protocol marks a major step in Lightning's capacity to serve as the underlying value transfer protocol of the internet. \"\"From our standpoint, we're particularly interested in the fiat and stablecoin aspects, because we're really big into emerging markets,\"\" explained Stark. \"\"That's something near and dear to our hearts. We've seen a lot of adoption there, and there's a big demand for that.\"\" The ultimate goal is to create a frictionless on-ramp to the global economy requiring only a mobile phone, in order to include as many people as possible in the process. Lightning Labs \u2013 which also announced it raised $70 million in Series B funding led by early Tesla and SpaceX backer Valor Equity Partners \u2013 says it is releasing the technical spec for the Taro protocol, so that it can incorporate feedback from developers as it continues to build the protocol.

The FCC in 2020 authorized Amazon's system, which the company has said it will \"\"invest more than $10 billion\"\" to build. Amazon is set to begin testing a pair of Kuiper prototype satellites with a launch scheduled for late this year, launching on ABL Space's RS1 rocket , before moving on to launch operational satellites. Although Amazon has not said when the Kuiper launch campaign will begin, FCC rules require the company to deploy half of its planned satellites within six years \u2013 meaning about 1,600 in orbit by July 2026. \"\"We still have lots of work ahead, but the team has continued to hit milestone after milestone across every aspect of our satellite system.

The terms of the contracts announced Tuesday were not disclosed. ULA will use its Vulcan rockets for the 38 Kuiper launches, in addition to the nine Atlas V rocket launches for Kuiper that Amazon purchased last year . ULA's Vulcan rocket has yet to launch, but its debut mission is set for late this year. While ULA has not disclosed the base price of a Vulcan launch, the U.S. government purchased launches on the rocket for about $112 million each. Arianespace will fly its 18 Kuiper missions on its coming Ariane 6 rockets, which are also set to debut later this year.

The company has not publicly revealed a price for New Glenn launches, but an Arianespace estimate two years ago put the Blue Origin rocket at $68 million per launch. While both companies were founded by Bezos, Blue Origin is separate from Amazon.

But, even with Musk's pledge to launch competitors, Amazon and SpaceX have long sparred in front of federal regulators over their respective satellite internet networks , Kuiper and Starlink. SpaceX has established a sizable lead over Amazon in the race to provide internet from space, having launched about 2,000 Starlink satellites so far, serving about 250,000 total subscribers . But Amazon is betting on its global footprint to close that gap. The company says the Kuiper network \"\"will leverage Amazon's global logistics and operations footprint, as well as Amazon Web Services' (AWS) networking and infrastructure.\"\" Amazon has a leg-up in addressing one key obstacle to affordable satellite internet, too: the antennas that customers need to connect.

But that hasn't exactly transpired, if data from Goldman is any indication. The bank said 236,000 people applied for internships globally at the bank, including 79,000 in the Americas, according to data provided to CNBC. Instead of dissuading applicants, last year's Wall Street boom \u2014 which led to overworked bankers, as well as widespread raises and bigger bonuses \u2014 seems to have drawn more interest to the top-ranked investment bank. The number of college students applying to internships jumped about 16% from 2021, reaching a record level, according to a person with knowledge of Goldman's figures. The internships are a rite of passage on Wall Street and an essential pipeline of talent for investment banks and the broader financial universe.

BA.2 became dominant in the U.S. last week, and now appears on track to displace the earlier version of omicron, BA.1. Ali Mokdad, an epidemiologist at the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation in Washington state, projected that will happen within the next two weeks.

Renewed outbreaks have occurred in major European nations, including the U.K. and Germany. Here in the U.S., though, White House chief medial advisor Dr. Anthony Fauci has said infections might rise, but he doesn't expect another major surge. Mokdad said he believes infections in the U.S. will likely level off for a week or two and then decline until winter. In the U.S., new infections and hospital admissions have declined more than 90% since the peak of the omicron wave in January. The average number of people hospitalized with Covid in the U.S. was 11,000 as of Monday, the lowest level since 2020, according to data from the federal Health and Human Services Department. The U.S. reported a seven-day average of about 28,000 new infections on Sunday, the lowest level since last July, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. BA.2 generally does not make people sicker than the earlier version of omicron, and the vaccines have the same level of effectiveness against it, according to studies from South Africa and Qatar. However, omicron in general is adept at evading the protective antibodies generated by the vaccines and causing breakthrough infections that normally cause mild illness.

The war in Ukraine and the Russian capture of the Chornobyl and Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plants sent a shock wave of fear around the world. At the same time, Russia's control over natural gas supplies to Europe, and increased recognition of the urgency of reducing greenhouse gas emissions, is making nuclear power more attractive. Nuclear power generation does not release any greenhouse gasses and is categorized as \"\"clean\"\" energy by the U.S Department of Energy . The United States is spending billions of dollars on nuclear power plants that are losing money because it needs that emission-free energy to meet decarbonization goals. Nuclear power plants generate 19% of the electricity in the U.S., according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration . ( Sixty-one percent comes from fossil fuels and 20% comes from renewables.) So where are these nuclear power plants located? CNBC used data from the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission to plot where nuclear reactors are currently in operation , where they are undergoing decommissioning processes to be shut down and where licenses have been granted for new reactors . There are 93 commercial nuclear reactors operating in the United States at 55 locations in 28 states. The majority of nuclear reactors are in the eastern portion of the U.S. Currently, 25 reactors are in some phase of decommissioning . There are also licenses approved for another eight nuclear reactors to be constructed in the U.S. However, only two of those reactors, units 3 and 4 at the Vogtle plant in Georgia, are currently under construction, according to Scott Burnell, a spokesperson for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Other companies hold the licenses to begin construction \"\"but none of them have made the business decision to move forward,\"\" Burnell said. The license doesn't expire, though, so \"\"as long as the supporting information remains valid, the construction authorization is good to go,\"\" Burnell told CNBC. Nuclear power is highly subject to local political sentiments. In California, for example, strong anti-nuclear sentiment played a part in the decommissioning of the last operational nuclear power reactor in the state, Diablo Canyon . In Illinois, by contrast, the state legislature voted to spend as much as $694 million to keep nuclear reactors open . Another lingering and prominent issue for nuclear power is the lack of a permanent waste disposal solution. Nuclear power generation results in dangerous, radioactive waste. The scientific consensus is that nuclear waste should be stored deep in the ground where it can remain and, over many thousands of years, lose its radioactivity. In the United States, there is no permanent nuclear waste disposal. Nuclear waste sits in dry casks at locations of current and former nuclear reactors. A mine at Yucca Mountain in Nevada was the closest the U.S. got to permanent disposal for nuclear waste, but the location was shut down, due in large part to the influence of Harry Reid, a Democratic senator from the state. Start-ups are working on several other possible solutions, including sliding long, thin canisters of nuclear waste deep into boreholes in the ground . \u00a0\u2014 Map created by Crystal Mercedes .

Yield curve inversions have historically occurred prior to recessions, as investors signal their doubts about the near-term health of the economy by selling out of short-dated bonds in favor of longer-dated debt. There are concerns that the Federal Reserve's aggressive hiking of interest rates, along with rising inflation, could weigh on economic growth. Investors awaited minutes from the previous Fed meeting, due out on Wednesday afternoon, for any clues to the central bank's plan for tightening monetary policy. Longview Economics CEO Chris Watling told CNBC's \"\"Squawk Box Europe\"\" on Tuesday that while the inversion of the yield curve is an indicator of an economic downturn, it is \"\"one of many and it's really the only one that's signaling recession\u00a0risk at the moment and it can be extremely early, up to two years early.\"\"\u00a0\u00a0 Stock picks and investing trends from CNBC Pro: JPMorgan says 3 stocks could be winners if U.S.-listed Chinese stocks avert delisting Goldman names four megatrends with 'oversold' stocks to buy right now Goldman is worried this could be like the 1970s and is recommending these stocks Meanwhile, Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is expected to address an emergency meeting of the United Nations Security Council on Tuesday.

There are many feelings one could have in a moment like this, but for me there are none bigger, or more lasting, than the feelings of gratitude and love that I have for this team, this company, and this mission. I've never been more fulfilled professionally. I've never been happier professionally. This team - and what we've built together - are the reasons for that. We're leading the industry creatively. We've elevated technology, product, and design to the highest levels in the company. We're operating as one team, proudly and successfully going direct to consumers across the globe. It has been deeply gratifying to lean into the future alongside each of you and to do so with conviction. The joys are many, especially the walk-and-talks that I've had with a great many WarnerMedia team members, diving deeply into the matters at hand, whether on the storied lot in Burbank, along The High Line at Hudson Yards, in and around Techwood and CNN Center, inside our archives, across the expansive lot at Leavesden, at any of our game studio locations, or the many other locations where this team quite literally changes the world. Apparently, word has gotten around that when Jason calls for a walk-and-talk, be sure to wear comfortable walking shoes! For those of you that know me well (or follow me on Twitter), it comes as no surprise that I adore our history and the footprint we have as a company across the globe. I've done my best to visit and get to know as many of you as possible and to photographically document my love for this team and this company along the way via social media. So, when my wife Jamie and I were thinking about what we could do on our own to adequately express our appreciation to each of you, we came up with the idea to create a series of artifacts featuring some of the photos I've taken to celebrate this team and WarnerMedia. We're inviting each of you to visit this website\u00a0and choose an image that resonates\u2026from the iconic Warner Bros. water tower, the gleaming towers of Hudson Yards, the virtual production stage in Leavesden, and several more. An artifact featuring that image (and a note from me on the back) will be shipped to you in the coming weeks. Our hope is that this memento will bring a smile and remind you of the important contributions we've made to the 99-year legacy of this extraordinary company. Leading this team has been the honor of my lifetime. My heart is so full, and I am beyond thankful to each of you. There is no better team on the planet, and I will savor every last step as I wander the lot in Burbank several more times this week, with this team on my mind, always. This is a breaking news story.

Patrick Pleul | AFP | Getty Images The Securities Exchange Commission has another reason to come after Elon Musk. The world's richest man disclosed Monday that he's acquired a 9.2% stake in Twitter , sending the social media company shares up more than 28% in afternoon trading. The filing marks Musk's accumulation of common shares to March 14. The stake is passive, according to the financial disclosure. VIDEO 5:13 05:13 I think Elon Musk should get Twitter board seats immediately, says Josh Brown Halftime Report The SEC mandates that anyone who acquires more than 5% of a company's common shares disclose their holdings within 10 calendar days . Musk signed his filing 21 days after March 14. On March 25, the day after the 10-day period lapsed, Musk posted a poll on Twitter, with the following preamble: \"\"Free speech is essential to a functioning democracy. Do you believe Twitter rigorously adheres to this principle?\"\" He followed up on his own poll by stating, \"\"The consequences of this poll will be important. Please vote carefully.\"\" Musk had actually already acquired his large stake in Twitter at this point \u2014 and legally had to reveal it. SEC disclosure punishments are historically modest \u2014 often about $100,000 . Musk's net worth, according to Forbes , is about $300 billion. A $100,000 fine amounts to .00003% of his wealth. The median net worth of a U.S. household is about $122,000. An equivalent fine to a median American household would be about 3 cents. Musk's intentions with his large stake are unclear. In late January, conservative pundit Dinesh D'Souza, who was convicted of campaign finance fraud in 2014, tagged Musk in a tweet telling him that he \"\"can dramatically change the political and cultural landscape\"\" by buying and taking over \"\"a major social media platform.\"\" Musk responded saying, \"\"Interesting ideas.\"\" Musk vs. the SEC The Tesla and SpaceX CEO has a history of courting controversy and promoting his companies on the Twitter platform, while dismissing some SEC rules. In September 2018, the SEC charged Musk \u00a0with making \"\"false and misleading\"\" statements to investors when he announced via Twitter in August that year he was considering taking Tesla private at $420 a share and had funding secured. Shares of the electric vehicle maker seesawed for weeks after that \u2014 and the deal Musk alluded to never materialized. Musk and Tesla eventually agreed to a settlement with the government and revised it in 2019 . Under its terms, Musk and Tesla each had to pay $20 million in fines to the SEC, and Musk had to temporarily relinquish his role as chairman of the company's board. In June 2020, the SEC said Musk was in violation of some terms of the agreement that required the CEO to have tweets preapproved if they contained material business information about Tesla likely to affect the share price. Musk had tweeted that Tesla's stock price was too high, which sent the shares down. Earlier this year, the SEC subpoenaed Musk and Tesla after he informally polled his\u00a0 tens of millions of Twitter \u00a0followers, asking\u00a0 if he should sell 10% of his Tesla holdings. The majority of his followers voted yes. The Tesla CEO's battles with regulators tend to be public and messy, occasionally including vulgar taunts. He has expressed his displeasure with the SEC on Twitter on multiple occasions, including in\u00a0 October 2018 \u00a0when he called the agency the \"\"shortseller enrichment commission,\"\" and in\u00a0 July 2020 \u00a0when he wrote: \"\"SEC, three letter acronym, middle word is Elon's.\"\" Musk hasn't said anything publicly about his intentions regarding Twitter management or ownership since the financial filing was published. His only statement since disclosing the stake \u2014 on Twitter \u2014 was \"\"Oh hi lol.\"\" Musk did not immediately respond to a request for comment from CNBC.

He will play nine more practice holes on Wednesday before making a final decision, but will be doing so with the intention of playing Thursday. \"\"As of right now,\"\" Woods said, \"\"I feel like I'm going to play.\"\" There had been plenty of signals in recent days that Woods was on the cusp of deciding it was time to play again.

On Tuesday morning, with bad weather in the forecast, he spent plenty of time in the practice areas. \"\"It's great to be back,\"\" Woods said. Woods played in December at the PNC Challenge, a 36-hole scramble on a flat Florida course where he and his son Charlie finished second to John Daly and his son. Woods was allowed to use a cart in that event, and when those rounds were over he flatly dismissed any notion that his game was tour-ready again. \"\"I can't compete against these guys right now, no,\"\" Woods said on Dec. 19. \"\"It's going to take a lot of work to get to where I feel like I can compete at these guys and be at a high level.\"\" About 3-1/2 months later, Woods apparently feels differently.

It's called Windows Autopatch and will come standard in Windows Enterprise E3 and E5, which organizations can deploy by subscribing to Microsoft 365. Under CEO Satya Nadella , Microsoft has been lauded for its transition from desktop software to cloud computing, but the company hasn't been able to eliminate the burden of updates that force IT staffers into action while office workers put their work on pause. Microsoft intends for Windows Autopatch to simultaneously free up IT and enable a simpler experience for employees. The refinement could contribute to revenue growth in the software maker's staid Windows division by luring customers to more lucrative subscriptions. The Microsoft 365 suite includes Office productivity software and enterprise mobility and security, in addition to Windows. Besides keeping Windows current on workers' machines, Windows Autopatch will handle updates for Office applications and Edge internet browsers. Microsoft announced a preview in November, and customers will be able to access it so long as they pay for the necessary subscriptions in July. The new feature won't necessarily be a cure-all for Microsoft, which has released new Windows features alongside security fixes. \"\"We still see patching is a problem,\"\" said Michael Cherry, a senior analyst at Directions on Microsoft, a company that advises organizations on Microsoft products. Cherry said it can be hard to isolate critical fixes from larger changes that IT might view as unnecessary for many employees. Windows revenue growth accelerated in the past three quarters as users spent more time on video calls, shopping online and playing video games on PCs. Subscriptions to Microsoft 365 fall under a category called Windows Commercial, which also includes advanced security products. Unlike sales of Windows licenses to device makers, Windows Commercial revenue isn't closely tied to device sales. Windows Commercial \"\"is increasingly becoming a larger part of the total Windows revenue base,\"\" analysts at Stifel, which has s buy rating on Microsoft stock, wrote in a note to clients over the weekend. Also on Tuesday, Microsoft announced several updates coming to the Windows 11 operating system it released last year . They include a Do Not Disturb mode, app folders in the Start menu and the ability to view multiple tabs in a single File Explorer window.

Citizens of the Planet | Universal Images Group | Getty Images Oil prices rose on Tuesday as Europe announced plans to impose new sanctions on Russian oil imports to punish Moscow over alleged war crimes in Ukraine, raising concerns over tighter global supply. Brent crude was up 63 cents at $108.16 per barrel. U.S. West Texas Intermediate advanced 47 cents to $103.70. \"\"With the European Union working on new sanctions that may target Russia's oil industry, crude prices could edge up in the near term,\"\" FXTM analyst Lukman Otunuga said. The West is planning new sanctions against Russia over civilian killings in Ukraine, with President Joe Biden's national security adviser saying that new U.S. sanctions against Moscow would be announced this week. The European Commission on Tuesday proposed new sanctions against Russia, including a ban on buying Russian coal and on Russian ships entering EU ports. German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said the ban on coal will be followed by oil and then gas. To calm oil prices, U.S.-allied countries agreed last week to a coordinated oil release from strategic reserves for the second time in a month. However, Japanese industry minister Koichi Hagiuda on Tuesday said that the International Energy Agency (IEA) was still examining details of the release. Oil prices jumped by more than $2 after his comments. Ole Hansen, head of commodity strategy at Saxo Bank, expects oil prices to trade between $90 and $120 a barrel during the second quarter. \"\"Key events that could trigger additional uncertainty remain the prospect for an Iran nuclear deal, Venezuela being allowed to increase production and, not least, an increase in U.S. shale oil production,\"\" he said. The United States still believes there is an opportunity to overcome the remaining differences with Iran in talks over its nuclear programme, State Department spokesman Ned Price said on Monday. Any signs that the United States and Iran are moving closer to a nuclear deal, which would return up to 1.3 million barrels per day of Iranian oil to global markets, would weigh on oil prices, BCA research said. The end of the refinery maintenance period in Europe also lent some support to oil prices, analysts said, because it will allow higher crude intake. Also Iraq announced on Tuesday that it produced 4.15 million barrels per day (bpd) of oil in March, 222,000 bpd short of its production quota under an agreement with other OPEC+ producers. Underinvestment and maintenance problems have stymied efforts by some other OPEC+ producers to raise output, including Angola and Nigeria, adding to the supply tightness. Kazakhstan, an OPEC+ producer, has also cut its oil output forecast to 85.7 million tonnes this year from the previous target of 87.5 million after damage to the Caspian Pipeline Consortium terminal in Russia.

Jim Watson | AFP | Getty Images Twitter shares rose over 7% Tuesday in premarket trading after Elon Musk was appointed to the company's board of directors . The appointment, disclosed in a release filed with the SEC, comes after Musk took a 9.2% passive stake in the company, making him the largest shareholder. The stake is worth almost $3 billion. Twitter's share price had climbed 7.32% to $53.63 at 9:02 a.m. ET Tuesday. The rise comes hot on the heels of Twitter's best day of trading since its IPO in 2013, with shares surging over 27% on Monday. \"\"Through conversations with Elon in recent weeks, it became clear to us that he would bring great value to our Board,\"\" Twitter CEO Parag Agrawal said in a tweet. \"\"He's both a passionate believer and intense critic of the service which is exactly what we need on Twitter, and in the boardroom, to make us stronger in the long-term,\"\" he added. Musk replied saying he was looking forward to working with Agrawal and the Twitter board to make \"\"significant improvements\"\" to the platform. On Monday, Musk asked Twitter users if they want an edit button to be added to the platform. \"\"Do you want an edit button?\"\" Musk asked in a poll. At the time of writing, the poll had received 2,333,856 votes, with some 73.6% voting \"\"yse\"\" and 26.4% voting \"\"on.\"\" Agrawal retweeted Musk and urged people to \"\"vote carefully\"\" as the consequences \"\"will be important.\"\" On April 1, or April Fools' Day, Twitter tweeted a message through its official account saying that it was working on an \"\"edit\"\" button. When the company was asked if it was a joke, it said: \"\"We cannot confirm or deny but we may edit our statement later.\"\" While an edit button would allow Twitter users to fix grammatical errors, there are concerns that it would also enable them to edit the meaning of a tweet, which could be problematic if that tweet had gone viral and had millions of impressions. In response, Meta CTO Andrew Bosworth claimed that he and his team solved the issue on Facebook \"\"a long time ago\"\" by including an indicator that it had been edited along with a change log.

Vanessa Leroy | Bloomberg | Getty Images The currently approved Covid-19 vaccines may need an update to ensure a high level of protection as the virus continues to evolve, according to the Food and Drug Administration. The FDA, in a briefing document published ahead of an advisory committee meeting this week, said scientists still don't entirely understand Covid variants and the effectiveness of the vaccines. For example, mutations to the spike protein, which is used by the virus to invade human cells, have reduced effectiveness of current vaccines. That's because today's Covid shots were developed to target the spike protein in the original strain of the virus that emerged in Wuhan, China in late 2019. The FDA's advisory committee of outside vaccine experts on Wednesday will discuss how the U.S. can develop a transparent process to make recommendations about changing the composition of the current ones if needed. Pfizer and Moderna are conducting clinical trials on vaccines based on the omicron variant, the dominant version of the virus worldwide. Omicron and its rapidly spreading subvariant BA.2 have numerous mutations that give them an enhanced capability to breakthrough the vaccines and cause infections that normally result in mild illness. The effectiveness of Pfizer or Moderna's two-dose vaccines against mild illness from omicron dropped from 70% to just 10% 25 weeks after the second shot, according to the U.K. Health Security Agenc y. A third dose increases protection to 75% for about four weeks, but it then declines to between 25% to 40% after 15 weeks. The effectiveness of two vaccine doses against hospitalization from omicron dropped from 71% to 54% after five months, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention . A third shot increased protection to 91%, which then declined to 78% after four months. When the vaccines were first authorized in December 2020 they were 90% effective at preventing infections that resulted in symptoms, according to the CDC. The FDA, in the briefing document, said it is impossible to predict which variant will become dominant and for how long, creating a practical limit to how often the vaccines can be modified. The drug regulator also said it needs to see clinical trial data before authorizing any changes in vaccine composition to ensure they are effective and do not raise safety concerns.

The World Health Organization meets twice a year to analyze the circulating flu variants and makes a recommendation on the composition of the vaccine. The FDA's outside experts, the Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee, meets to make its own recommendation, which the U.S. then accepts. The FDA is not bound by the WHO's flu vaccine recommendation, but the drug regulator normally comes to the same conclusion. However, the FDA said in its briefing document that it may need to consider updating the Covid vaccines without a prior WHO recommendation. It's unclear if the spread of Covid will follow a pattern that would make a global recommendation on vaccine updates possible, the FDA said in the document. The FDA advisory committee on Wednesday will also discuss whether fourth Covid shots may be warranted for younger people in the U.S. at some point. The drug regulator authorized fourth Pfizer and Moderna doses for adults ages 50 and older last week based on data from Israel indicating that an additional shot reduces mortality in older people. The FDA committee did not meet to make a recommendation before that decision, and it will not hold a vote on any recommendations Wednesday. Dr. Peter Marks, head of the FDA office responsible for vaccine safety and efficacy, said last week that additional booster doses might be needed in the fall . Public health experts and epidemiologists say the U.S. could face another wave of Covid infection at that time as immunity from the vaccines wanes and people move indoors to escape the colder weather.

The trio all used to work at IBM and in 2017 they developed an AI called DeepStack . It became the first AI capable of beating professional poker players at heads-up no-limit Texas hold'em poker. Now they're looking to apply some of these concepts to financial markets. \"\"Our idea is that rather than playing poker, our algorithms will play algorithmic trading,\"\" Schmid told CNBC. \"\"We are also looking into crypto.\"\" They intend to use a technique known as reinforcement learning to train an AI system to buy and sell shares and make a profit. Reinforcement learning involves training an AI to achieve a particular goal (be that winning a game of chess or spotting a tumor on a mammogram) by giving it a reward each time. Schmid said he's not concerned about regulators clamping down on the technology as other companies are already doing similar things. Indeed, EquiLibre Technologies will be competing with the likes of AI algorithmic stock picking products Candlestick and Yuyostox. \"\"Most of the trading out there is already algorithmic,\"\" Schmid said. \"\"We just want to do better algorithms than the ones that are already out there.\"\" In the long run, EquiLibre Technologies hopes to either use the AI it develops to underpin a new hedge fund or sell it to a large institutional bank or another investor.

Bloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty Images The fight to keep global heating under 1.5 degrees Celsius has reached \"\"now or never\"\" territory, according to a new report released Monday by the world's leading climate scientists. The highly anticipated report, delayed slightly due to last-minute disputes over the exact wording of the document, says curbing global heating to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels would require greenhouse gas emissions to peak before 2025 at the latest. At the same time, methane, a potent greenhouse gas, would also need to be reduced by roughly one-third. The U.N.'s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change said it is \"\"almost inevitable\"\" that humanity will briefly surpass the critical temperature threshold of 1.5 degrees in this scenario, but it could return below this level by the end of the century. \"\"It's now or never, if we want to limit global warming to 1.5\u00b0C,\"\" IPCC Working Group III co-chair Jim Skea said in a statement accompanying the report. \"\"Without immediate and deep emissions reductions across all sectors, it will be impossible.\"\" The 1.5 degrees Celsius goal is the aspirational temperature threshold ascribed in the landmark 2015 Paris Agreement . It is recognized as a crucial global target because beyond this level, so-called tipping points become more likely. These are thresholds at which small changes can lead to dramatic shifts in Earth's entire life support system. It has been feared that Russia's unprovoked onslaught in Ukraine may eclipse the findings, despite the fact that the report could be the last comprehensive assessment of climate science while there is still time to secure a liveable future.

Julia Steinberger Ecological economist and professor from the University of Lausanne The report marks the third installment from the IPCC in less than eight months, with one additional document scheduled for later in the year. The previous volumes have assessed the causes and impacts of the climate emergency but this one focused on mitigation. \"\"First thing is, we're on the wrong track,\"\" Julia Steinberger, ecological economist and professor from Switzerland's University of Lausanne, told CNBC via telephone. \"\"In terms of a trajectory and also in terms of policies, we are just not on track for 1.5 or even 2 degrees.\"\" Steinberger, a lead author on the IPCC's latest report, described the warning that global emissions must peak by 2025 at the latest as \"\"a bit of a bombshell\"\" given how little time there is to prevent the worst of what the climate crisis has in store. \"\"We're not talking about transition anymore.

For instance, in just the last few weeks, an ice shelf the size of New York City collapsed in East Antarctica following record high temperatures and heavy rains deluged Australia's east coast , submerging entire towns. The catastrophic scenario prompted the largest mass youth climate strike since 2019 last month, with hundreds of thousands of environmental activists from 93 countries on all continents marching under the banner of \"\"#PeopleNotProfit.\"\" The Fridays For Future movement called for climate reparations and justice. What does the report say? IPCC Chair Hoesung Lee said the report shows humanity is \"\"at a crossroads,\"\" but the tools and know-how required to limit global heating are available. \"\"I am encouraged by climate action being taken in many countries,\"\" Lee said. \"\"There are policies, regulations and market instruments that are proving effective. If these are scaled up and applied more widely and equitably, they can support deep emissions reductions and stimulate innovation.\"\" The U.N. climate panel has said that to keep rising global temperatures under 1.5 degrees Celsius this century, emissions from warming gases must be halved by the end of the decade. IPCC scientists also repeated calls for a substantial reduction in fossil fuel use to curb global heating, now at 1.1 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. Heavy rains deluged Australia's east coast in early March, submerging entire towns. Lisa Maree Williams | Getty Images News | Getty Images Reacting to the IPCC's findings on Monday, U.S. Special Presidential Envoy for Climate John Kerry said it \"\"represents a defining moment for our planet.\"\" \"\"The stakes are clear,\"\" Kerry said. \"\"Complacency will be met by irreversible and unthinkable impacts from climate change.\"\" The report says the average annual global greenhouse gas emissions were at their highest levels in human history from 2010 through to 2019, but the rate of growth has since slowed. This has coincided with increasing evidence of climate action, but the report warns that limiting global heating to 1.5 degrees will not be possible without immediate and deep emissions reductions across all sectors. These reductions will require major transitions in the energy sector, the report says, including a massive reduction in fossil fuel use, widespread electrification, improved energy efficiency and the use of alternative fuels \u2014 such as hydrogen. VIDEO 6:30 06:30 Degrowth: Is it time to live better with less? CNBC Explains Cities are thought to offer significant opportunities for emissions reductions. The report says this can be achieved through lower energy consumption, electrification of transport combined with low-emission energy sources and enhanced carbon uptake and storage using nature. \"\"Climate change is the result of more than a century of unsustainable energy and land use, lifestyles and patterns of consumption and production,\"\" the IPCC's Skea said. \"\"This report shows how taking action now can move us towards a fairer, more sustainable world.\"\" What is the IPCC? The IPCC is a U.N. body of 195 member states that assesses the science related to the climate crisis on behalf of governments every few years. It is currently in its sixth assessment cycle, having published its first major report in 1990. The first installment of the IPCC's Sixth Assessment Report, published in August , focused on the physical science basis of climate change. The findings made it clear that limiting global heating to 1.5 degrees Celsius would soon be beyond reach without immediate and large-scale reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. The second major report examined climate impacts and found that about half of the world's population is now acutely vulnerable to disasters stemming from the burning of fossil fuels. Published in late February , it warned that any further delay in concerted global action \"\"will miss a brief and rapidly closing window to secure a livable future.\"\" The final part of the IPCC's sixth assessment cycle is the so-called \"\"Synthesis Report,\"\" which combines the findings of each of the three previous installments. This is scheduled to be published in September. ", "polarity": 0.0622608740465883, "subjectivity": 0.40034786641929504}]
