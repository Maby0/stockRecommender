Total mortgage application volume fell another 6% last week compared with the previous week, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association's seasonally adjusted index. Volume was down 41% from the same week one year ago. The average contract interest rate for 30-year fixed-rate mortgages with conforming loan balances ($647,200 or less) increased to 4.90% from 4.80%, with points decreasing to 0.53 from 0.56 (including the origination fee) for loans with a 20% down payment. That rate was just 3.36% one year ago. That is the fourth consecutive week of increases. Applications to refinance a home loan, which have been falling steadily for months, dropped another 10% week to week. Refinance demand was 62% lower than the same week one year ago. \"\"Mortgage application volume continues to decline due to rapidly rising mortgage rates, as financial markets expect significantly tighter monetary policy in the coming months,\"\" said Joel Kan, an MBA economist. \"\"As higher rates reduce the incentive to refinance, application volume dropped to its lowest level since the spring of 2019.\"\" The refinance share of all applications fell to 38.8% from 51% a year ago. Mortgage applications to purchase a home declined 3% for the week and were 9% lower than the same week one year ago. A strong employment market with continuing wage growth is keeping housing demand hot, but the supply of existing homes for sale is still extremely lean. Bidding wars tend to be the rule, rather than the exception. Affordability is falling fast, and entry-level buyers are being sidelined. \"\"The elevated average purchase loan size, and steeper 8% drop in FHA purchase applications, are both indicative of first-time buyers being disproportionately impacted by supply and affordability challenges,\"\" added Kan. The drop in mortgage business is causing layoffs at companies like Movement Mortgage and Better.com. Mortgage companies had been on massive hiring sprees in the first year of the Covid pandemic , as interest rates set more than a dozen record lows and both refinance and purchase demand surged.

Bloomberg | Getty Images LONDON \u2014 A new omicron subvariant has been detected in the U.K. as the country faces a renewed surge in Covid-19 hospitalizations. The XE variant, as it is known, has so far been detected in 637 patients nationwide, according to the latest statistics from the U.K. Health Security Agency , which said there is currently not enough evidence to draw conclusions on its transmissibility or severity. XE contains a mix of the previously highly infectious omicron BA.1 strain, which emerged in late 2021, and the newer \"\"stealth\"\" BA.2 variant, currently the U.K.'s dominant variant. It is what's known as a \"\"recombinant,\"\" a type of variant that can occur when an individual becomes infected with two or more variants at the same time, resulting in a mixing of their genetic material within a patient's body. XE's transmissibility, severity not yet conclusive Such recombinants are not uncommon, having occurred several times during the coronavirus pandemic . Data on the new variant's severity and ability to evade vaccines is not yet clear, though early estimates suggest it could be more transmissible than earlier strains. UKHSA data shows XE has a growth rate of 9.8% above that of BA.2, while the World Health Organization has so far put that figure at 10%. Health authorities have said they are continuing to monitor the situation. \"\"This particular recombinant, XE, has shown a variable growth rate and we cannot yet confirm whether it has a true growth advantage. So far there is not enough evidence to draw conclusions about transmissibility, severity or vaccine effectiveness,\"\" UKHSA's chief medical advisor, professor Susan Hopkins, said. The earliest confirmed XE case in Britain has a specimen date of Jan. 19 of this year, suggesting it could have been in circulation in the population for several months. It has also been detected beyond the U.K. in Thailand. Surging cases It comes as the U.K. faces a new surge in infections. Still, the XE variant currently accounts for less than 1% of total Covid cases that have undergone genomic sequencing there. According to the Office for National Statistics, 4.9 million people in Britain, or 1 in 13, were infected with Covid as of March 26 \u2014 a record high since its survey began in April 2020. Hospitalizations, meanwhile, have risen more than 7% in the last week to over 16,500 . Older adults have proven particularly susceptible to the latest wave amid waning booster immunity and easing Covid restrictions. According to Imperial College's latest React study , an estimated 8.31% of the over-55 age group tested positive as of the end of March \u2014 nearly 20 times the average prevalence recorded since the survey started in May 2020. Cases among children and younger adults, meanwhile, appear to be plateauing. The findings mark the 19th and final round of the study as Covid restrictions and surveillance systems are unwound in the U.K. and beyond.

(Photo by John Lamparski/Getty Images) John Lamparski | Getty Images Entertainment | Getty Images Philadelphia Federal Reserve President Patrick Harker joined the chorus of central bankers warning about inflation and the interest rate hikes needed to control rising prices. In remarks Wednesday, the policymaker said he is worried about an inflation rate running at its highest level in 40 years . He anticipates the Fed will respond by raising rates and reducing the level of bonds it is holding on its balance sheet. \"\"Inflation is running far too high, and I am acutely concerned about this,\"\" Harker told the Delaware State Chamber of Commerce. \"\"The bottom line is that generous fiscal policies, supply chain disruptions and accommodative monetary policy have pushed inflation far higher than I \u2014 and my colleagues on the [Federal Open Market Committee] \u2014 are comfortable with,\"\" he said. \"\"I'm also worried that inflation expectations could become unmoored.\"\" The cautionary tone comes the day after two of his colleagues, Governor Lael Brainard and San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly, also expressed concern over inflation . Brainard, an influential policy \"\"dove\"\" who generally favors lower rates and less restrictive monetary policy, said reducing inflation is \"\"of paramount importance\"\" and would require \"\"a series of interest rate hikes\"\" and a \"\"rapid\"\" reduction of the balance sheet. Stocks dropped and bond yields rose following the comments. Harker's comments closely resembled Brainard's view on rate hikes. He said he expects \"\"a series of deliberate, methodical hikes as the year continues and the data evolve,\"\" though he wasn't quite as emphatic about the issue of balance sheet reductions. Harker is a nonvoting FOMC member who nonetheless has input into the committee's final decisions. On the broader economy, he sees growth as \"\"robust\"\" and anticipates inflation ultimately coming down to the Fed's 2% goal. At its March meeting, the FOMC approved its first rate increase in more than three years. Markets expect a succession of increases that ultimately could take short-term borrowing rates to 3% or above. Wall Street will be watching Wednesday as minutes from that meeting are released at 2 p.m. ET. Following the meeting, Chair Jerome Powell said the summary will reflect discussions on the bond holdings, which have brought the balance sheet to about $9 trillion.

Brittany Murray | Medianews Group | Getty Images Leading U.S. scientists and physicians worry that the FDA and CDC are moving too fast in approving a fourth round of Covid shots, with little public debate that gives the vaccine makers too big a role in setting the pace with which the doses are distributed across the nation. The top U.S. public health agencies last week endorsed a fourth Covid shot for older adults without holding public meetings, drawing criticism from leading vaccine experts who believe federal health officials haven't provided enough transparency about the reasons for the decision. The authorization of a fourth dose for adults age 50 and older comes as the scientific community is divided over whether the data is sufficient to support another round of boosters, and whether authorizing additional shots is a sustainable public health policy, especially since protection against infection simply wears off over time. There is a debate over whether the goal of the vaccines is to prevent severe illness, which they've largely achieved, or infection as well \u2014 a more challenging proposition. The Food and Drug Administration authorized a second booster shot for people age 50 and older last week, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention quickly backed their distribution hours later based on data from Israel, which rolled out fourth doses months ago. Dr. Peter Marks, who heads the FDA office responsible for vaccine safety and efficacy, said shortly after the decision that another round of boosters will likely be needed in the fall. Rapid approval The rapid regulatory clearance of fourth shots for older adults came just weeks after Pfizer and Moderna asked the FDA to permit them. Several FDA and CDC committee members as well as other leading experts said Pfizer and Moderna are playing too large a role in setting the agenda around U.S. vaccine policy by announcing the need for fourth doses and possibly a variant-specific vaccine before the public health agencies have made any recommendations. Moderna CEO Stephane Bancel said during a January interview with Goldman Sachs that fourth doses would be needed in the fall as the protective antibodies from the shots wane over time. Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla told CNBC in early March, before the company filed its request with the FDA, that there's a need for a fourth dose though he said the regulators would ultimately come to their own conclusion. \"\"I just think it's sort of booster mania. I think the companies are frankly acting like public health agencies,\"\" said Dr. Paul Offit, a member of the FDA committee and one of the nation's top vaccine experts. Offit said the CDC, which has the final say on vaccine recommendations, needs to develop a clear national strategy to reduce public confusion about what it means to be fully vaccinated at this stage in the pandemic. Michael Osterholm, a leading epidemiologist, said repeated boosting is not a sustainable public health strategy due to the challenge posed by waning immunity against infection. \"\"We're not gonna be able to boost our way out of this,\"\" said Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota. Call for more transparency The FDA and CDC vaccine advisory panels weigh safety and efficacy data before making recommendations to top federal health officials on the best path forward. Though the recommendations are nonbinding, the meetings provide an open forum where the public can listen to the nation's top health experts debate the pros and cons of vaccine policy and often even participate by phoning in to voice their views. The FDA's Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee is meeting Wednesday to debate the future of boosters. However, they will not vote on any specific recommendations, according to the FDA. The CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices also did not meet before CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky signed off on the fourth shots for older adults last week. \"\"It's just sort of fait accompli,\"\" Offit said. \"\"I feel that we're in a time, this sort of Covid exceptionalism, where we don't do things the way we normally do it, which is that the science precedes the recommendation. Here, it's the other way around,\"\" Offit said. Offit said that the FDA is effectively asking the public to believe that the data supports a fourth dose by providing sufficient protection against serious illness. He said the American public benefits from hearing an open discussion about vaccine decisions, particularly at a time when many people are not taking advantage of the third dose. Offit is an infectious disease expert at Children's Hospital Philadelphia and a co-inventor of a rotavirus vaccine. VIDEO 1:45 01:45 FDA authorizes fourth Covid vaccine dose for people age 50 and older Squawk on the Street Marks, during a call with reporters last week, said the FDA did not call a committee meeting because the decision was \"\"relatively straightforward.\"\" He said data from Israel suggested a fourth dose can reduce the risk of hospitalization and death in older adults. The CDC, in a statement to CNBC, said the fourth dose was an incremental change that did not need to go before its committee. Dr. William Schaffner, a non-voting member of ACIP, disagreed that the CDC recommendation was an incremental change. Schaffner said clearing fourth doses for older adults is a big decision that would have benefited from a meeting of outside advisors to provide the public with transparency. \"\"I think to have this decision made in house behind closed doors without having the transparency of a full debate that a regularly called ACIP meeting would have provided \u2013I think that's unfortunate,\"\" said Schaffner, an infectious disease expert at Vanderbilt University Medical Center. Dr. James Hildreth, who is attending the FDA committee's Wednesday meeting as a temporary member, noted that the drug regulator wasn't required to call a public meeting before authorizing the shots, and the agency has seasoned experts who can determine if there is evidence to support a new authorization. However, Hildreth said moving forward with out a recommendation from outside experts creates bad optics. \"\"When the FDA makes a decision like that without calling together an outside group of experts, it just adds to the optics of the pharmaceutical companies having an impact on decisions that are being made,\"\" said Hildreth, president of Meharry Medical College in Nashville, Tennessee. Meharry is a clinical trial site for Novavax's vaccine as well as Moderna's shots for younger children.

The protection provided by the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines against infection has declined substantially over time, particularly in the context of omicron, which has numerous mutations that give it an enhanced capability to cause breakthrough infections and mild illness. However, the vaccines are still providing substantial protection against severe illness. \"\"If you've gotten a mild illness after you've been vaccinated, you've won \u2014 that's it. You've been prevented from having serious illness, which is the stated goal of this vaccine,\"\" said Offit, who believes three doses were necessary for the elderly and four for the people with weak immune systems, but is skeptical of the need for additional shots right now. But if the goal is also to prevent infection, that means, at least for now, booster shots are the only available tool to increase antibodies until a longer lasting vaccine is available. The problem is that the vaccines eventually run into diminishing returns, according John Moore, \u00a0a professor of microbiology and immunology at Weill Cornell Medical College. Moore said a three-dose regimen is fairly standard with vaccines to help boost the immune system to its peak response. The fourth shot, however, begins to hit a ceiling \u2014 at least in terms of protecting younger people against infection. The Israeli Health Ministry and scientists at Sheba Medical Center found that a fourth dose does restores antibodies that waned off after a third dose among health-care workers ages 18 and older, but it provided little protection against infection. Pfizer cited that study, which has not undergone peer review, among others in its statement on the FDA authorization, focusing on the increased antibodies without highlighting the issues with breakthrough infections. Different age, different needs Dr. Peter Hotez, a vaccine expert at the Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, strongly supports a fourth dose for older adults, pointing to a CDC study from February that found the third shot's effectiveness against hospitalization dropped from 91% to 78% after four months. Pfizer, in its public statements on the fourth dose, cited a separate Israeli study that found a fourth dose reduced mortality by 78% in people ages 60 and over. The study from Ben Gurion University and Clalit Health Services, which has not undergone peer review, analyzed the medical records of more than 500,000 people. 'We continue to collect and assess all available data and remain in open dialogue with regulators and health authorities to help inform a Covid-19 vaccine strategy as the virus evolves,\"\" Pfizer said in a statement to CNBC. While the Ben Gurion study may point in the direction of benefit for older adults at the moment, the evidence for boosting younger adults again is scant as the U.S. considers lowering the eligibility for fourth doses sometime later in the year. VIDEO 1:59 01:59 Moderna CEO Stephane Bancel on fourth Covid vaccine dose, BA.2 omicron variant Squawk Box Dr. Gili Regev-Yochay and her team of scientists at Sheba said a fourth dose \"\"may only have marginal benefits\"\" for younger people, according to a letter published in the New England Journal of Medicine. While Pfizer originally filed for adults age 65 and older, Moderna asked the FDA authorize a fourth dose for ages 18 and older. Moore called Moderna's filing \"\"aggressive,\"\" arguing that it didn't distinguish between the needs of the elderly, who may benefit from an additional dose, compared with younger adults where the data is less convincing. Moderna CEO Stephane Bancel told CNBC last month that the company wanted to give the FDA flexibility to decide which age group would benefit most from a fourth shot right now. Moderna, in its public statements on its application for a fourth dose, pointed to data from Israel but didn't cite specific studies. Though Hotez supports a fourth dose for older adults, he said the FDA and the CDC have not done an effective job at communicating whether the goal of the vaccines is to prevent severe illness, infection or both, and the vaccines makers have filled that void with statements on data from their clinical trials and lab studies. Hotez and a team of scientists in Texas developed a Covid vaccine, Corbevax, based on traditional protein-based technology that has received authorization in India. Hotez also expressed frustration that the U.S. relies heavily on data from abroad, particularly Israel and the U.K. Offit also questioned why the U.S. is relying on data from countries that are smaller than the U.S. and have different demographic backgrounds. Long-term strategy needed Hildreth said the U.S. should put off additional booster doses as long as the public health situation allows so the nation can more clearly define how it measures protection against the virus and develop a long-term strategy to achieve that end. He said if the public is asked to get boosted every several months, many people will simply stop listening. \"\"We don't know a specific measure we can do to say whether or not a person is truly protected, and whether or that's the same with everybody,\"\" said Hildreth. For example, there's no clear measure of whether a certain level of antibodies is sufficient to protect people, Hildreth said. Beyond vaccination with the current vaccines, Pfizer and Moderna are developing shots that target omicron as well as other variants. Dr. Arnold Monto, who is chairing the FDA's committee meeting on booster strategy Wednesday, said public health authorities need to develop a consensus about what goes into the vaccines moving forward. Monto said collaboration between the vaccine makers and the government is crucial, but industry has started playing larger public role in decisions about about what kind of vaccines should be developed to target specific Covid variants. \"\"Industry has a double-headed goal. They are trying to do public good like we all are. They also have stockholders, and we need to be sure that the public health good is kept mind,\"\" Monto said.

It stood at 3.38% one year ago today.\u00a0 Mortgage rates, which follow loosely the yield on the U.S. 10-year Treasury, have been climbing since the start of the year, partially due to the Federal Reserve's policies to curb inflation as well as the global economic turmoil resulting from the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

Combined, Russia and Belarus had provided about 40% of the world's exports of potash, according to Morgan Stanley. Russia's exports were hit by sanctions. Further, in February, a major Belarus producer declared force majeure \u2014 a statement that it wouldn't be able to uphold its contracts due to forces beyond its control. Russia also exported 11% of the world's urea, and 48% of the ammonium nitrate. Russia and Ukraine together export 28% of fertilizers made from nitrogen and phosphorous, as well as potassium, according to Morgan Stanley. Disruptions of those shipments due to sanctions and war has sent fertilizer prices skyrocketing. High grain prices are rising even more.\u00a0 VIDEO 3:53 03:53 The global shortage of fertilizer is a huge problem, says CF Industries Holdings CEO Closing Bell \"\"It is a huge problem,\"\" said CF Industries CEO Tony Will in a recent CNBC appearance. He said global fertilizer supplies are very tight. CF manufactures and distributes fertilizers. \"\"It's a confluence of factors, unprecedented demand coupled with a huge fall off in supply availability, only just exacerbated by the war in Ukraine and what's going on with exports coming out of Russia and Ukraine,\"\" Will added. A contributor to higher costs and shortages \"\"All of this is a double whammy, if not a triple whammy,\"\" said Bart Melek, global head of commodity strategy at TD Securities. \"\"We have geopolitical risk, higher input costs and basically shortages.\"\"\u00a0 \"\"Agriculture is absolutely going to get hit. In the case of Canada, it's good for Saskatchewan, which is the largest producer of potash in the world, but farmers are going to get hurt because per acre they're going to pay a lot more,\"\" Melek said. \"\"They're going to get lower yield simply because they're economizing, particularly in emerging markets.\"\" Grain shortages will drive up the cost of basic foods and other commodities. \"\"That's going to lead to higher input costs for producing everything from grains, wheat and corn. The input costs are higher now because you're going to have scarcity that bids the price up as well,\"\" Melek said. Meanwhile, prices for cows, steers and pork bellies have also climbed significantly, he added. VIDEO 2:33 02:33 We're not just concerned about food prices but also availability, says Ospraie's Anderson Halftime Report Some fertilizers have more than doubled in price. For instance, Melek said potash traded in Vancouver was priced at about $210 per metric tons at the beginning of 2021, and it's now valued at $565. He added that urea for delivery to the Middle East was trading at $268 per metric ton on the Chicago Board of Trade in early 2021 and was valued at $887.50 on Tuesday. Will said CF Industries is running its plants around the clock, foregoing some maintenance and trying to expedite shipments to areas in need. \"\"There are no new tons to make. It's just a matter of trying to get them there as quickly as we can into the marketplace,\"\" he said. Just as the price of fertilizers has jumped, the price of agricultural commodities has also been soaring, amid fears of shortages. \"\"We are absolutely facing a problem of catastrophic proportion here,\"\" said Will. \"\"Not only is the issue lack of availability and affordability of nutrients and inputs, but Russia and Ukraine have historically exported about 30% of the global wheat trade and 20% of global corn trade.\"\" He added that there are stocks of those commodities that are not getting out to the market because the Black Sea is closed. Rising prices for wheat, corn and soy Wheat futures for July were down slightly Wednesday. They rose about 4% Tuesday on worries about Ukraine but also on worse-than-expected U.S. crop conditions. Corn futures prices are up nearly 30% year-to-date and inched downward Wednesday on the Chicago Board of Trade. Soybean futures were also slightly lower. Morgan Stanley expects grain prices to remain above last year's levels until 2023. \"\"Before the Ukraine war, the dry weather in [Latin America] took inventories to levels that would already keep grain prices high,\"\" wrote the Morgan Stanley analysts in a report. \"\"The war adds uncertainties related to Ukrainian corn/wheat supply, and, more important to fertilizer use and global yields,\"\" they said. \"\"Due to this, our base crop price scenario implies a 2-3% reduction of yields in higher-cost regions, with risks of larger disruptions depending on fertilizer availability and weather.\"\" The Morgan Stanley analysts said they expect higher prices in 2022 and 2023, but after that they expect inventories should normalize with more supply from Latin America. They also anticipate prices will align closer with production costs and drop 15% to 20% below longer-term soy and corn contracts. Zoom In IconArrows pointing outwards Melek said corn rose 57% in 2021, and it could be volatile this year, averaging up 25% higher on the year. Live cattle prices rose 19% last year and could gain another 15% in 2022. Wheat was up 27% in 2021 and could tack on another 22% this year, he said. Melek said the high prices are being driven by tight supplies and shortages. \"\"We're talking about an erosion of food security on a scale we have not seen for a long time, and I think it will touch people in the lower income distribution in North America,\"\" he added. Melek said farmers are likely to consider rotating in less fertilizer-intensive corps and will economize on the amount of nutrients they use. \"\"Consumers are going to make choices too,\"\" he said. Fertilizer production relies on natural gas, and that has made a difference to U.S. producers. The biggest buyers of the top three types of fertilizers are Brazil, India, the U.S. and China, according to Morgan Stanley. \"\"Being a North American producer is huge for us. We pay somewhere in the neighborhood of $5 to $6 per million British thermal unit [MMBtu] of natural gas,\"\" CF's Will said. \"\"Europe pays $35 to $38 per MMBtu\u2026That is a huge spread between low cost production, and it's one of the reasons why fertilizer price is what it is. It's not only a lack of availability, but the high-cost producers are very high cost.\"\" For some farmers, the high-priced or unavailable fertilizer will mean crops may not get as much nourishment this year. In turn, yields could be lower. \"\"In close contact with a number of our customers in Latin America, we're going to begin exporting on a humanitarian basis just to get nutrients down there to a region that is a rich growing area but also starved for nutrients right now,\"\" said CF's Will.

Fed Governor Lael Brainard and San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly both issued comments that showed they envision higher rates and, in the former's case, an aggressive drawdown of the assets the central bank is holding on its balance sheet. Investors didn't particularly like what they heard, sending major averages considerably lower on the day and the 10-year Treasury yield to a new 2022 high . Lael Brainard, governor of the U.S. Federal Reserve, speaks during a Senate Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee confirmation hearing in Washington, D.C., U.S., on Thursday, Jan. 13, 2022. Al Drago | Bloomberg | Getty Images \"\"It is of paramount importance to get inflation down,\"\" Brainard said during a Minneapolis Fed webinar. The Federal Open Market Committee, which sets interest rates, \"\"will continue tightening monetary policy methodically through a series of interest rate increases and by starting to reduce the balance sheet at a rapid pace as soon as our May meeting.\"\" The comments helped knock down a positive opening on Wall Street that ultimately turned into a nearly 1% loss for the Dow Jones Industrial Average . The more aggressive Fed chatter also comes as the 30-year fixed mortgage rate topped 5% , a key threshold, which could slow the housing market. 'We're not going to let this go forever' Later in the day, Daly said inflation running at a 40-year high \"\"is as harmful as not having a job.\"\" Speaking to the Native American Finance Officers Association, she assured the group that the Fed is on the case. \"\"Most Americans, most people, most businesses, hopefully people in tribal nations, you all have confidence that we're not going to let this go forever,\"\" Daly said. \"\"But if you don't have that confidence, let me give it to you.\"\" She assured those in attendance several times that interest rates are heading higher, though she added that she doesn't think it will cause a recession. Raising rates \"\"is what is necessary to ensure that again, [you] go to bed at night, you're not worrying about whether prices will be higher, considerably higher tomorrow,\"\" Daly added. The Fed already has enacted its first rate hike of the year, a 0.25 percentage point move in March. Markets expect increases at each of the six remaining meetings this year, possibly totaling 2.5 percentage points. Two policy 'doves' What made the two officials' comments more striking is that they are considered to be in the camp of Fed \"\"doves\"\" \u2014 meaning that they usually favor low rates and less restrictive policies. That they both see a rather urgent need to tighten underscores how seriously the Fed is taking the threat. Brainard's voice carries a little extra heft in that she has been nominated to be vice chair of the FOMC, a position that makes her the top lieutenant for Chairman Jerome Powell .

Here are his top picks Deutsche becomes first major bank to forecast a recession in the U.S. JPMorgan says 3 stocks could be winners if U.S.-listed Chinese stocks avert delisting Wells Fargo says buy these three fintech stocks, sees $1.5 trillion revenue opportunity Brainard said she expects the Fed's $9 trillion balance sheet to \"\"shrink considerably more rapidly\"\" than was the case during the last rundown in 2017-19. In that episode, the Fed allowed $50 billion a month in proceeds from maturing bonds to roll off while reinvesting the rest. Her comments opened the door to what many economists expect to be a monthly roll-off around $80 billion to $100 billion. Reducing the balance sheet \"\"will contribute to monetary policy tightening over and above the expected increases in the policy rate,\"\" Brainard added. \"\"Currently, inflation is much too high and is subject to upside risks. The Committee is prepared to take stronger action if indicators of inflation and inflation expectations indicate that such action is warranted,\"\" she added. Daly echoed the idea that the balance sheet reduction could start in May, adding that the Fed's commitment to fighting inflation \"\"will mean interest rates go up.\"\" \"\"But inflation, what people are paying day in and day out is on the minds of everyone, they go to bed at night thinking about it wake up in the morning thinking about rent, transportation, gas prices, food prices, so we as a Federal Reserve are on a path to raise the interest rates,\"\" she said.

Aurora announced Wednesday that it has begun a pilot test of self-driving tractor-trailers with logistics giant Werner Enterprises . Aurora's self-driving system \u2013 called Aurora Driver \u2013 will be operating Werner trucks on a roughly 600-mile stretch of highway between Fort Worth and El Paso. That particular stretch is an important segment of a heavily traveled truck route between Atlanta and Los Angeles. But according to the companies, it's a monotonous nine-hour drive that human truck drivers would rather avoid \u2013 making it an ideal use case for the Aurora Driver system, which never gets bored. For the time being, the Aurora-driven trucks will have human operators on board, ready to take over if needed. Aurora's system also isn't being asked to handle any tight urban driving situations. Despite the constraints, the test is an important step forward for Aurora's driverless technology at a moment when trucking firms like Werner are grappling with a nationwide shortage of qualified human truck drivers . Werner's CEO, Derek Leathers, was quick to say that the goal isn't to replace the company's human drivers entirely. Instead, as he sees it, self-driving systems like Aurora's will be able to handle routes that Werner's human drivers would rather avoid, while expanding the company's capacity during busy periods. \"\"We look forward to building a hybrid world where drivers continue to haul freight while autonomous trucks supplement rising demand,\"\" Leathers said. This is Werner's first experience with autonomous trucks, but it's not the Aurora Driver's first deployment in big rigs. Both FedEx and Uber Technologies ' trucking unit, Uber Freight, are running similar pilot programs with Aurora-driven heavy trucks.

As the West enters its third year of drought, water sources are drying up , and restrictions on the Colorado River are now hitting all sectors of the Western economy, including homebuilding. While there is a shortage of water, there is also a shortage of housing. The U.S. currently needs over a million more homes just to meet the current demand, according to an estimate by the National Association of Home Builders. Other estimates are even higher. As the millennial generation hits its prime homebuying years and Gen Z enters the fray, the supply of homes for sale is at a record low. Builders are hampered by high costs for land, labor and materials, so they are focused on the West and areas like the suburbs of Phoenix, which are growing rapidly. On a vast swath of land in Buckeye, Arizona, just west of Phoenix, the Howard Hughes Corporation is developing one of the largest master-planned communities in the nation, Douglas Ranch , flooding the desert with housing. Howard Hughes CEO David O'Reilly says water will not be a problem. \"\"Every home will have low flow fixtures, national desert landscaping, drip irrigation and reclamation,\"\" he said, adding, \"\"we work with the local municipalities, the city of Buckeye, all the water districts, to make sure that we're enacting real conservation measures, not just at our property, but across the entire region.\"\" The community is projected to have more than a 100,000 homes, bringing in at least 300,000 new residents. Big public builders like Pulte , Taylor Morrison , Lennar , DR Horton and Toll Brothers have already expressed interest in building the homes, according to the Howard Hughes Corp. And it's just one of more than two dozen developments in the works around Phoenix, all as the West is in the midst of its worst drought in more than 1,000 years . \"\"They're expecting the growth in this area to be a million people. And there isn't the water to sustain that growth. Not with groundwater,\"\" said Kathleen Ferris, senior water research fellow at Arizona State University. Ferris produced a documentary about the state's 1980 Groundwater Management Act. It requires developers to prove there is 100 years' worth of water in the ground on which they're building. Douglas Ranch sits on the Hassayampa Aquifer, which will be its primary source of water. \u00a0\"\"And the problem is that with climate change there aren't backup water supplies that you can use to save a development that's based totally on groundwater. If it loses all of its water supply, there's no water to back that up,\"\" said Ferris. Mark Stapp is director of Arizona State University's real estate development program at the W.P. Carey School of Business. He points to various reservoirs that could replenish the groundwater, but admits there is still risk due to the sheer scale of development. \u00a0\"\"I would say that there's a legitimate concern about our future, and policy-makers are very aware of this,\"\" said Stapp. O'Reilly argues that the current need for housing surpasses future concerns that could be unfounded. \"\"I don't think the answer is to tell people that are looking for an affordable home in Arizona, 'You can't live here, go somewhere else.' I think the responsible answer, the thoughtful answer, is to build them affordable homes, but to build it in a self-sustaining manner,\"\" O'Reilly said. A report last spring from ASU's Kyle Center for Water Policy warned the amount of groundwater in the Hassayampa subbasin is considerably less than regulators estimate, and that without a change in direction, \"\" the physical groundwater supply under Buckeye will decrease and will not be sustainable.\"\" The report also says that hundred-year model for groundwater is constantly changing, especially given the changing climate. The state's department of water resources is now in the process of determining if the basin does in fact have a hundred years' worth of water. \"\"The bottom line is that there are places in this state, in this valley where there are sufficient water supplies to support new growth. We don't need to go way out in the desert and pump groundwater to build new homes,\"\" said Ferris. The land, of course, is cheaper out in the desert, but Ferris argues, \"\"Well, at some point there's a cost to that.\"\" \u00a0 \u00a0 ", "polarity": 0.08752525252525256, "subjectivity": 0.3817395240924652}, {"id": 107042430, "datePublished": "2022-04-06T15:37:05+0000", "url": "https://www.cnbc.com/2022/04/06/this-crypto-fund-has-outperformed-bitcoin-for-the-last-five-years-heres-how.html", "articleText": "A visual representation of Bitcoin. Edward Smith | Getty Images In a space filled with venture investors and traders, a blockchain fund run by value managers thinks it can give investors greater returns than bitcoin itself. Bitcoin has been called the best performing asset of the decade by some . Off the Chain Capital, a fund that deploys a traditional value investing strategy \u2013 using fundamental analysis to find undervalued assets \u2013 says its fund has outperformed bitcoin in each of the last five years. The fund has averaged 133% per year since its inception in 2016, compared to about 108% per year on average for bitcoin, according to Off the Chain. The firm used the compound annual growth rate for both the fund and bitcoin using a beginning date of Dec. 31, 2016 and ending Feb. 28, 2022. \"\"We've outperformed bitcoin five out of five years, and we've done it with 80% less volatility than bitcoin,\"\" said Brian Estes, the fund's CEO and chief investment officer. \"\"That's what I'm really proud of, because I built this so endowments, foundations and other conservative investors could gain exposure to blockchain assets and get that downside protection.\"\" It also said it has outperformed the S&amp;P 500 by 3,653% in the same period, and is 99.99% uncorrelated to the broad market index, meaning the two do not move up and down in tandem. VIDEO 8:57 08:57 Defiance ETFs' Sylvia Jablonski on what's next for crypto prices as bitcoin retreats from rally Crypto World Looking for value The fund's strategy is to find mispriced assets in the blockchain space. It aims to buy one dollar's worth of blockchain assets for 50 cents and make returns on the purchase of the assets, rather than buying them at fair market value and letting them rise. This way it can apply a value approach while capturing the growth of the still-young industry. For example, Off the Chain was a big buyer of shares of Mike Novogratz's Galaxy Digital two years ago, which went for about 70 cents then, Estes said. The stock closed Tuesday at $15.79 a share. Silvergate Bank is another company being mispriced, according to Estes. The crypto-friendly bank went public two years ago and was valued as a bank, when it operates like a crypto company. \"\"It was being valued at eight times earnings, and three times book value and what people didn't understand is that Silvergate is not a bank, it's a crypto company that basically has a monopoly on most of the crypto companies.\"\" As a result, its earnings are growing at more than 100% a year, he added. Private equity accounts for about half of the portfolio. The firm also looks for mispriced digital assets, including bitcoin. Providing diversification Off the Chain is one of the largest buyers of Mt. Gox bankruptcy claims. Mt. Gox was once the largest custodian of bitcoin until a Russian hacker stole nearly all of it \u2014 about 740,000 bitcoins then worth $460 million. The fund buys those claims from people at an average discount of about 80%, Estes said. \"\"It is our view that bitcoin is the winner of the store of value and is a major diversification instrument for portfolio allocators. If you can't outperform bitcoin as a fund, you might as well just own bitcoin and not pay fees to manage,\"\" Purcell said. It also sees both Binance and its utility token, BNB, as undervalued assets. \"\"It is currently valued the same as Coinbase , but it trades about 4.2 times the volume of Coinbase,\"\" Purcell said of the exchange. \"\"They've also developed the Binance Smart Chain, which is taking developers away from other communities such as Ethereum, and we believe that is a value play.\"\" The fund currently has about 200 limited partners and $399 million under management. It mainly targets institutions, endowments, family offices and other high net worth individuals for about a $1 million minimum. Estes said the fund currently has capacity for another $200 million to come into the fund. It's also \"\"very likely to be opening a bitcoin artificial intelligent algorithmic trading fund over the next six months.\"\" ", "polarity": 0.10256146903205726, "subjectivity": 0.3652373171490818}, {"id": 107041458, "datePublished": "2022-04-06T14:30:01+0000", "url": "https://www.cnbc.com/2022/04/06/porsche-taking-stake-in-e-fuels-maker-highly-innovative-fuels-global.html", "articleText": "In this article VOW3-DE A Porsche 911 Carrera 4S stands in the evening light in a drive-in cinema on the circuit of the Leipzig Porsche factory. Jan Woitas | picture alliance via Getty Images DETROIT \u2014 Porsche is upping its investment in the development of climate-neutral \"\"e-fuels\"\" made to replace gasoline in traditional combustion engines. The German automaker, owned by Volkswagen , announced on Wednesday a $75 million \"\"long-term\"\" investment in Highly Innovative Fuels Global, a manufacturer headquartered in the U.S. with operations in Chile. Porsche will acquire 12.5% of the Delaware-based holding company. The move builds on an existing tie-up between the companies. In late 2020, Porsche announced a roughly $24 million investment in a pilot plant being produced by HIF in Chile. The plant is expected to begin production later this year of e-fuels, which are made from hydrogen and carbon dioxide. \"\"Today is an important milestone in our commitment to e-fuels,\"\" Barbara Frenkel, head of procurement for Porsche, said during a media roundtable from Chile. \"\"We see our participation in HIF Global as a long-term investment and the use of e-fuels is, of course, of great interest to the automotive industry \u2026 it is also effective for aviation and shipping industries.\"\" Porsche's new investment is part of a larger international financing round of $260 million, according to HIF. Other investors include the Chilean company Andes Mining &amp; Energy (AME) and American companies EIG, Baker Hughes and Gemstone Investments. HIF said the additional capital will be used to develop industrial e-fuel facilities next year in the United States, followed by similar facilities in Chile and Australia in 2024. VIDEO 16:53 16:53 How Porsche went from sports cars to SUVs Autos Electricity-based fuels, or e-fuels, are clean, carbon-neutral fuels produced from renewable, green hydrogen and carbon dioxide taken from the atmosphere, according to HIF. They can act like gasoline, allowing owners of current and classic vehicles a more environmentally friendly way to drive. E-fuels could allow companies like Porsche to continue producing vehicles such as the iconic 911 sports car with a traditional engine alongside new electric models, despite increasing regulations away from fossil fuels. While electric vehicles can offer outstanding performance, the driving dynamics of the vehicles are different than traditional engines. Porsche, which is now the second largest shareholder in the company behind AME, expects to use the e-fuels from Chile first in motorsports, followed potentially by uses in new consumer vehicles.

The San Francisco-headquartered firm announced Wednesday that it is adding trains, buses, planes and car rentals to its U.K. app this year. The move is part of a pilot that could be expanded to other countries at a later date if it goes well. While Uber won't provide these travel services itself, it will allow users to book them through its app following software integrations with platforms that sell tickets. The tech giant, which may take a cut on each booking, said it plans to announce various partners in the coming months. Uber said the integrations will help to boost app usage among its users in the U.K, who also have the choice of using apps like Bolt and Free Now. The U.K. is one of Uber's largest markets outside the U.S. Jamie Heywood, Uber's boss in the U.K., said in a statement that Uber hopes to become \"\"a one-stop-shop for all your travel needs.\"\" \"\"You have been able to book rides, bikes, boat services and scooters on the Uber app for a number of years, so adding trains and coaches is a natural progression,\"\" he said. He added: \"\"Later this year we plan to incorporate flights, and in the future hotels, by integrating leading partners into the Uber app to create a seamless door-to-door travel experience.\"\" Uber also plans to let people buy Eurostar train tickets through the app. Eurostar allows travelers to commute from London to Paris and other cities via the Channel Tunnel.

Joe Maher | Disasters Emergency Committee | Getty Images Entertainment | Getty Images Grammy Award-winning songwriter Ed Sheeran won a U.K. copyright battle over his 2017 hit \"\"Shape of You\"\" on Wednesday, then slammed what he described as a \"\"culture\"\" of baseless lawsuits intended to squeeze money out of artists eager to avoid the expense of a trial. The British pop star and his co-writers, Snow Patrol's John McDaid and producer Steven McCutcheon, had denied allegations that the song copied part of 2015\u2032s \"\"Oh Why\"\" by Sami Chokri, who performs under the name Sami Switch. \"\"Whilst we're obviously happy with the result, I feel like claims like this are way too common now and have become a culture where a claim is made with the idea that a settlement will be cheaper than taking it to court, even if there is no basis for the claim,\"\" Sheerhan said in a video posted on Twitter. \"\"It's really damaging to the songwriting industry.\"\" Andrew Sutcliffe, the lawyer for the co-writers of \"\"Oh Why,\u2033 argued that there was an \"\"indisputable similarity between the works.\"\" He claimed that Sheeran had \"\"Oh Why\"\" in his head \"\"consciously or unconsciously\"\" when \"\"Shape of You\"\" was written in 2016. The plaintiffs alleged that the refrain \"\"Oh I, Oh I, Oh I\"\" in the chorus of \"\"Shape Of You\"\" was \"\"strikingly similar\"\" to the line \"\"Oh why, Oh why, Oh why\"\" in their track. During the 11-day trial, Sheeran denied allegations that he \"\"borrows\"\" ideas from unknown songwriters without acknowledgement and said he has always been fair in crediting people who contribute to his albums. In Wednesday's ruling, High Court Judge Antony Zacaroli concluded that Sheeran \"\"neither deliberately nor subconsciously\"\" copied a phrase from \"\"Oh Why\u2033 when writing his smash hit. Sheeran, McDaid and Mac said in a statement that the cost of the case was more than financial. The stress of going to trial also hurts creativity, means less time to make music and takes an emotional toll, they said. \"\"It is so painful to hear someone publicly and aggressively challenge your integrity,\u2033 the trio said. \"\"It is so painful to have to defend yourself against accusations that you have done something that you haven't done, and would never do.\u2033 \"\"Shape of You\"\" was the biggest-selling song in the U.K. in 2017.
