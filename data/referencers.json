But regulators in China shut the deal down in 2021. Months later, Tencent is shutting down its own game live streaming service Penguin E-Sports. Feature China | Future Publishing | Getty Images Tencent is shutting down its video game streaming platform months after Beijing shut down a huge merger that would have made the Chinese internet giant a major player in the area. The service Penguin Esports will shut down from June 7, Tencent said, citing a change of business strategy. Like Amazon's Twitch, Tencent's Penguin Esports hosts livestreams of professional gaming tournaments and other video game-related content. Tencent is one of the world's largest online gaming players and is aggressively pushing into the area of professional gaming, also known as e-sports, for a potential new revenue stream. The latest move is a blow to those ambitions and comes months after Chinese regulators blocked a key merger that would have turned Tencent into one of the world's largest game streaming players. In 2020, Tencent proposed merging Huya and DouYu , two live game streaming companies that it had substantial stakes in. That would have valued the new company at around $6 billion at the time and Tencent planned to move its Penguin Esports brand under the combined entity. But last year, Chinese regulators blocked the deal over antitrust concerns . From Thursday, Tencent said it would stop new user registration on Penguin Esports. On June 7, the app will be removed from app stores and its servers will stop operating. Tencent continues to invest in areas like e-sports but regulators have also tightened gaming regulations in China to protect addiction among younger users, including cutting down the amount of time kids under 18 can play online and and freezing approvals of new titles. That is weighing on Tencent, which reported its slowest quarterly revenue growth on record in the fourth quarter of last year.

Kennedy International Airport on May 12, 2020 in New York, NY. Pablo Monslave | Getty Images JetBlue Airways executives on Wednesday said acquiring Spirit Airlines is the airline's ticket to growth and a shot at better competing against larger rivals. The $3.6 billion all-cash bid, which Spirit called \"\"unsolicited,\"\" casts doubt on the latter's planned tie-up with Frontier Airlines , which the carriers announced in February. Spirit shares surged more than 22% on Tuesday after news of JetBlue's offer broke, but fell more than 2% Wednesday, while JetBlue dropped nearly 9% and Frontier shed 11%. VIDEO 4:02 04:02 Fmr. Continental CEO discusses JetBlue's bid for Spirit and the travel landscape The Exchange The triangle between the carriers shows appetite for consolidation of midsize carriers, particularly those that compete for price-conscious leisure travelers. That segment of the market has become even more important in the Covid pandemic , which devastated international and corporate travel. JetBlue intends to scrap Spirit's brand from its bright-yellow planes to bare-bones service that has provided comedians with fodder for years. And yet Spirit has worked to improve customer service and reliability and even ranked 6th in U.S. on-time arrivals last year, while JetBlue came in 9th. Paying for growth JetBlue's CEO Robin Hayes told\u00a0analysts on a call Wednesday\u00a0that executives there had been thinking about how to grow and compete against bigger airlines for years. But said once the Spirit-Frontier deal was announced \"\"it created a window of opportunity that if you don't act in it, it's gone.\"\" The deal would have $700 million in annual synergies, JetBlue said. Spirit and JetBlue overlap on 11% of their routes, according to aviation data firm Cirium. \"\"This looks like an\u00a0airline\u00a0that's just run out of ideas on growth,\"\" Brett Snyder, a founder of the Cranky Flier travel website, said about JetBlue. The executives said the deal would help them grow at airports where large airlines dominate like Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport, Chicago's O'Hare International Airport and Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport. It would also speed up growth in airports in Florida, where Spirit is based and JetBlue runs a large operation, as well as in other cities like Las Vegas. Fort Lauderdale is a key airport for both carriers and the bid could be somewhat defensive. \"\"The very last thing JetBlue needs is for Spirit to get stronger in Fort Lauderdale,\"\" said Craig Jenks, president of Airline/Aircraft Projects, an aviation consulting firm. \"\"This is a battleground specifically in the lower-cost sector.\"\" VIDEO 3:04 03:04 Cowen's Helane Becker says she's not 100% convinced on JetBlue-Spirit deal Closing Bell JetBlue made a failed bid for Virgin America, which ended up combining with Alaska Airlines , its only other attempt at an acquisition in its more than 22 years of flying. A deal with Spirit would allow JetBlue to quickly grow its fleet thanks to a large Airbus orderbook both carriers have. A combined JetBlue and Spirit would have a total fleet of 675 planes in 2027, compared with 346 planes in that year without it. JetBlue would also increase its head count, particularly pilots, to 32,000. Hayes said he expects the pilot shortage, which is already hampering growth, in the U.S. to persist for several years. Different business model Frontier and Spirit have very similar business models: low fares, sparse onboard service and fees for everything from hand baggage to seat selection. JetBlue, on the other hand, has spent years building up its Mint business class service that includes lie-flat beds and full meals. The same day it announced its surprise bid for Spirit, JetBlue also disclosed start dates for its first flights from Boston to London. But JetBlue is mostly concentrated in domestic travel. The Spirit deal, if approved by antitrust officials at the Justice Department, would give JetBlue more breadth and ability to compete with larger carriers, executives said. JetBlue didn't disclose how much it would cost to reconfigure Spirit's Airbus planes to match JetBlue interiors, which have inflight entertainment like seatback screens and fewer seats, but the carrier said it would be \"\"a multi-year\"\" capital expenditure. Wrapping Spirit into JetBlue could help Frontier, especially in Florida, since Spirit would no longer be following such a similar model, said Snyder. \"\"Blue skies in Florida for Frontier,\"\" he said. \"\"They don't have a serious competitor anymore.\"\" Confounded analysts The airline's bid for Spirit confounded some analysts. UBS called it a \"\"headscratcher.\"\" \"\"Wait, What?\"\" asked MKM Partners. Bank of America said while both JetBlue and Spirit have Airbus planes \"\"we struggle to find additional benefits for JBLU.\"\" Raymond James downgraded JetBlue to market perform after the announcement and said product and labor would be tough to combine. That issue with American \"\"The process is also likely to distract or possibly unwind current initiatives, most notably the Northeast alliance with American,\"\" Raymond James airline analyst Savanthi Syth wrote. \"\"Moreover, the prospect of elevated debt, even if manageable, is likely to be an overhang on investor sentiment.\"\" The Biden administration has been scrutinizing mergers and other alliances. The Justice Department sued last year to block JetBlue's partnership with American Airlines , which allows the airlines to coordinate routes in airports in the New York City area and Boston. The DOJ didn't comment on JetBlue's bid for Spirit. Asked whether JetBlue would give up that alliance to get a deal with Spirit through regulators, JetBlue CEO Hayes said on the analyst call that the deal is \"\"complementary\"\" to its American Airlines' partnership and said he was optimistic that both would pass muster. American declined to comment, but JetBlue executives said they discussed their plan with counterparts at American, after they disclosed the bid. If approved, the deal could put more pressure on other airlines to merge but it isn't clear whether that will happen, especially since the Biden administration has promised to scrutinize such deals. Acquisition vs organic growth Alaska Airlines, for example, whose merger with Virgin America closed in late 2016, is aiming for growth on its own. That will be fueled by its\u00a0 recently upsized \u00a0order for Boeing 737 Max aircraft. \"\"My preference is always organic growth over acquisition. You're controlling so many elements of the growth,\"\" Alaska Airlines CEO Ben Minicucci said in an interview on the Seattle-based airline's investor day last month. He pointed to challenges like merging IT systems and company culture. Minicucci added, \"\"I never rule anything out.\"\" ", "polarity": 0.08335401048815684, "subjectivity": 0.3870098194488439}, {"id": 107043131, "datePublished": "2022-04-07T11:18:28+0000", "url": "https://www.cnbc.com/2022/04/07/britain-eyes-nuclear-wind-fossil-fuels-in-bid-for-energy-security.html", "articleText": "Alongside a ramp up in nuclear power, the British Energy Security Strategy envisages up to 50 GW of offshore wind and 10 GW of hydrogen \u2013 half of which would be so-called green hydrogen \u2013 by 2030. Christopher Furlong | Getty Images News | Getty Images The U.K. government has revealed details of its long awaited, \"\"bold\"\" energy security strategy, but critics have derided its inclusion of fossil fuels and what they view as a lack of ambition. In a release Wednesday, the government heralded a \"\"major acceleration of homegrown power in Britain\u2019s plan for greater energy independence.\"\" The plans \u2014 known as the British Energy Security Strategy \u2014 mean that more \"\"cleaner\"\" and \"\"affordable\"\" energy will be produced in Great Britain, the government said, as the country seeks to \"\"boost long-term energy independence, security and prosperity.\"\" The government is now targeting as much as 24 gigawatts of nuclear power by 2050, which it said would represent around a quarter of the country's projected electricity demand. The strategy could see as many as eight reactors developed. Alongside nuclear, the plans include up to 50 GW of offshore wind and 10 GW of \"\"low carbon\"\" hydrogen capacity, at least half of which would be so-called green hydrogen, by 2030. The government also said solar capacity could be set to increase fivefold by 2035, up from 14 GW today. When it comes to onshore wind \u2014 a divisive subject for Prime Minister Boris Johnson's Conservative Party \u2014 the government said it would consult on \"\"developing partnerships with a limited number of supportive communities who wish to host new onshore wind infrastructure in return for guaranteed lower energy bills.\"\" Read more about clean energy from CNBC Pro Bernstein has named its top stock picks as green hydrogen becomes more attractive Goldman upgrades Generac, bets on increased adoption of company's clean energy products First Solar slides after Bank of America downgrades stock to underperform However, in a move that sparked outrage among environmental campaigners, the government also said its strategy would be \"\"supporting the production of domestic oil and gas in the nearer term,\"\" with a licensing round for new oil and gas projects in the North Sea slated for launch this fall. The government claimed its strategy could result in 95% of Great Britain's electricity being \"\"low carbon\"\" by 2030. \"\"The simple truth is that the more cheap, clean power we generate within our borders, the less exposed we will be to eye watering fossil fuel prices set by global markets we can't control,\"\" Kwasi Kwarteng, the country's business and energy secretary, said. \"\"Scaling up cheap renewables and new nuclear, while maximising North Sea production, is the best and only way to ensure our energy independence over the coming years.\"\" The strategy's publication comes at a time when Russia's invasion of Ukraine has heightened concerns about energy security. Russia is a major supplier of oil and gas, and its actions in Ukraine have caused a number of economies to try and find ways to reduce their reliance on it. In response to the invasion, the U.K. has said it will \"\"phase out imports of Russian oil\"\" \u2014 which meets 8% of its total oil demand \u2014 by the end of this year. Russian natural gas, the government says, made up \"\"less than 4%\"\" of its supply, adding that ministers were \"\"exploring options to reduce this further.\"\" Fool's gold? While Business Secretary Kwarteng was bullish about the strategy and its prospects, the plan drew ire from some quarters. \u00a0 \"\"This fails as a strategy, as it does not do the most obvious things that would reduce energy demand and protect households from price hikes,\"\" Danny Gross, an energy campaigner at Friends of the Earth, said.

'Moral and economic madness' The British Energy Security Strategy is being published in the same week that the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change released its latest report. \"\"Limiting global warming will require major transitions in the energy sector,\"\" the IPCC said in a news release. \"\"This will involve a substantial reduction in fossil fuel use, widespread electrification, improved energy efficiency, and use of alternative fuels (such as hydrogen).\"\" Commenting on the report, U.N. Secretary General Antonio Guterres pulled no punches. \"\"Climate activists are sometimes depicted as dangerous radicals,\"\" he said. \"\"But the truly dangerous radicals are the countries that are increasing the production of fossil fuels.\"\" In March, the International Energy Agency reported that 2021 saw energy-related carbon dioxide emissions rise to their highest level in history.

The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite dropped another 2.2%, bringing its week-to-date losses to 2.6%. Those losses came after comments from Fed Governor Lael Brainard pushed stock prices lower on Tuesday . \"\"It does seem like they are talking up the possibility of raising rates by 50 basis points at the next meeting so the hope is that message is well telegraphed in advance,\"\" said Brian Price, head of investment management at Commonwealth Financial Network. \"\"I expect that volatility will remain elevated for the time being as there is a lot of uncertainty for investors to digest right now.\"\"\u00a0 \u00a0 Investors await the weekly jobless claims data Thursday morning, which is expected to show a total of 200,000 claims filed.

Kennedy International Airport on May 12, 2020 in New York, NY. Pablo Monslave | Getty Images JetBlue Airways executives on Wednesday said acquiring Spirit Airlines is the airline's ticket to growth and a shot at better competing against larger rivals. The $3.6 billion all-cash bid, which Spirit called \"\"unsolicited,\"\" casts doubt on the latter's planned tie-up with Frontier Airlines , which the carriers announced in February. Spirit shares surged more than 22% on Tuesday after news of JetBlue's offer broke, but fell more than 2% Wednesday, while JetBlue dropped nearly 9% and Frontier shed 11%. VIDEO 4:02 04:02 Fmr. Continental CEO discusses JetBlue's bid for Spirit and the travel landscape The Exchange The triangle between the carriers shows appetite for consolidation of midsize carriers, particularly those that compete for price-conscious leisure travelers. That segment of the market has become even more important in the Covid pandemic , which devastated international and corporate travel. JetBlue intends to scrap Spirit's brand from its bright-yellow planes to bare-bones service that has provided comedians with fodder for years. And yet Spirit has worked to improve customer service and reliability and even ranked 6th in U.S. on-time arrivals last year, while JetBlue came in 9th. Paying for growth JetBlue's CEO Robin Hayes told\u00a0analysts on a call Wednesday\u00a0that executives there had been thinking about how to grow and compete against bigger airlines for years. But said once the Spirit-Frontier deal was announced \"\"it created a window of opportunity that if you don't act in it, it's gone.\"\" The deal would have $700 million in annual synergies, JetBlue said. Spirit and JetBlue overlap on 11% of their routes, according to aviation data firm Cirium. \"\"This looks like an\u00a0airline\u00a0that's just run out of ideas on growth,\"\" Brett Snyder, a founder of the Cranky Flier travel website, said about JetBlue. The executives said the deal would help them grow at airports where large airlines dominate like Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport, Chicago's O'Hare International Airport and Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport. It would also speed up growth in airports in Florida, where Spirit is based and JetBlue runs a large operation, as well as in other cities like Las Vegas. Fort Lauderdale is a key airport for both carriers and the bid could be somewhat defensive. \"\"The very last thing JetBlue needs is for Spirit to get stronger in Fort Lauderdale,\"\" said Craig Jenks, president of Airline/Aircraft Projects, an aviation consulting firm. \"\"This is a battleground specifically in the lower-cost sector.\"\" VIDEO 3:04 03:04 Cowen's Helane Becker says she's not 100% convinced on JetBlue-Spirit deal Closing Bell JetBlue made a failed bid for Virgin America, which ended up combining with Alaska Airlines , its only other attempt at an acquisition in its more than 22 years of flying. A deal with Spirit would allow JetBlue to quickly grow its fleet thanks to a large Airbus orderbook both carriers have. A combined JetBlue and Spirit would have a total fleet of 675 planes in 2027, compared with 346 planes in that year without it. JetBlue would also increase its head count, particularly pilots, to 32,000. Hayes said he expects the pilot shortage, which is already hampering growth, in the U.S. to persist for several years. Different business model Frontier and Spirit have very similar business models: low fares, sparse onboard service and fees for everything from hand baggage to seat selection. JetBlue, on the other hand, has spent years building up its Mint business class service that includes lie-flat beds and full meals. The same day it announced its surprise bid for Spirit, JetBlue also disclosed start dates for its first flights from Boston to London. But JetBlue is mostly concentrated in domestic travel. The Spirit deal, if approved by antitrust officials at the Justice Department, would give JetBlue more breadth and ability to compete with larger carriers, executives said. JetBlue didn't disclose how much it would cost to reconfigure Spirit's Airbus planes to match JetBlue interiors, which have inflight entertainment like seatback screens and fewer seats, but the carrier said it would be \"\"a multi-year\"\" capital expenditure. Wrapping Spirit into JetBlue could help Frontier, especially in Florida, since Spirit would no longer be following such a similar model, said Snyder. \"\"Blue skies in Florida for Frontier,\"\" he said. \"\"They don't have a serious competitor anymore.\"\" Confounded analysts The airline's bid for Spirit confounded some analysts. UBS called it a \"\"headscratcher.\"\" \"\"Wait, What?\"\" asked MKM Partners. Bank of America said while both JetBlue and Spirit have Airbus planes \"\"we struggle to find additional benefits for JBLU.\"\" Raymond James downgraded JetBlue to market perform after the announcement and said product and labor would be tough to combine. That issue with American \"\"The process is also likely to distract or possibly unwind current initiatives, most notably the Northeast alliance with American,\"\" Raymond James airline analyst Savanthi Syth wrote. \"\"Moreover, the prospect of elevated debt, even if manageable, is likely to be an overhang on investor sentiment.\"\" The Biden administration has been scrutinizing mergers and other alliances. The Justice Department sued last year to block JetBlue's partnership with American Airlines , which allows the airlines to coordinate routes in airports in the New York City area and Boston. The DOJ didn't comment on JetBlue's bid for Spirit. Asked whether JetBlue would give up that alliance to get a deal with Spirit through regulators, JetBlue CEO Hayes said on the analyst call that the deal is \"\"complementary\"\" to its American Airlines' partnership and said he was optimistic that both would pass muster. American declined to comment, but JetBlue executives said they discussed their plan with counterparts at American, after they disclosed the bid. If approved, the deal could put more pressure on other airlines to merge but it isn't clear whether that will happen, especially since the Biden administration has promised to scrutinize such deals. Acquisition vs organic growth Alaska Airlines, for example, whose merger with Virgin America closed in late 2016, is aiming for growth on its own. That will be fueled by its\u00a0 recently upsized \u00a0order for Boeing 737 Max aircraft. \"\"My preference is always organic growth over acquisition. You're controlling so many elements of the growth,\"\" Alaska Airlines CEO Ben Minicucci said in an interview on the Seattle-based airline's investor day last month. He pointed to challenges like merging IT systems and company culture.

Combined, Russia and Belarus had provided about 40% of the world's exports of potash, according to Morgan Stanley. Russia's exports were hit by sanctions. Further, in February, a major Belarus producer declared force majeure \u2014 a statement that it wouldn't be able to uphold its contracts due to forces beyond its control. Russia also exported 11% of the world's urea, and 48% of the ammonium nitrate. Russia and Ukraine together export 28% of fertilizers made from nitrogen and phosphorous, as well as potassium, according to Morgan Stanley. Disruptions of those shipments due to sanctions and war has sent fertilizer prices skyrocketing. High grain prices are rising even more.\u00a0 VIDEO 3:53 03:53 The global shortage of fertilizer is a huge problem, says CF Industries Holdings CEO Closing Bell \"\"It is a huge problem,\"\" said CF Industries CEO Tony Will in a recent CNBC appearance. He said global fertilizer supplies are very tight. CF manufactures and distributes fertilizers. \"\"It's a confluence of factors, unprecedented demand coupled with a huge fall off in supply availability, only just exacerbated by the war in Ukraine and what's going on with exports coming out of Russia and Ukraine,\"\" Will added. A contributor to higher costs and shortages \"\"All of this is a double whammy, if not a triple whammy,\"\" said Bart Melek, global head of commodity strategy at TD Securities. \"\"We have geopolitical risk, higher input costs and basically shortages.\"\"\u00a0 \"\"Agriculture is absolutely going to get hit. In the case of Canada, it's good for Saskatchewan, which is the largest producer of potash in the world, but farmers are going to get hurt because per acre they're going to pay a lot more,\"\" Melek said. \"\"They're going to get lower yield simply because they're economizing, particularly in emerging markets.\"\" Grain shortages will drive up the cost of basic foods and other commodities. \"\"That's going to lead to higher input costs for producing everything from grains, wheat and corn. The input costs are higher now because you're going to have scarcity that bids the price up as well,\"\" Melek said. Meanwhile, prices for cows, steers and pork bellies have also climbed significantly, he added. VIDEO 2:33 02:33 We're not just concerned about food prices but also availability, says Ospraie's Anderson Halftime Report Some fertilizers have more than doubled in price. For instance, Melek said potash traded in Vancouver was priced at about $210 per metric tons at the beginning of 2021, and it's now valued at $565. He added that urea for delivery to the Middle East was trading at $268 per metric ton on the Chicago Board of Trade in early 2021 and was valued at $887.50 on Tuesday. Will said CF Industries is running its plants around the clock, foregoing some maintenance and trying to expedite shipments to areas in need. \"\"There are no new tons to make. It's just a matter of trying to get them there as quickly as we can into the marketplace,\"\" he said. Just as the price of fertilizers has jumped, the price of agricultural commodities has also been soaring, amid fears of shortages. \"\"We are absolutely facing a problem of catastrophic proportion here,\"\" said Will. \"\"Not only is the issue lack of availability and affordability of nutrients and inputs, but Russia and Ukraine have historically exported about 30% of the global wheat trade and 20% of global corn trade.\"\" He added that there are stocks of those commodities that are not getting out to the market because the Black Sea is closed. Rising prices for wheat, corn and soy Wheat futures for July were down slightly Wednesday. They rose about 4% Tuesday on worries about Ukraine but also on worse-than-expected U.S. crop conditions. Corn futures prices are up nearly 30% year-to-date and inched downward Wednesday on the Chicago Board of Trade. Soybean futures were also slightly lower. Morgan Stanley expects grain prices to remain above last year's levels until 2023. \"\"Before the Ukraine war, the dry weather in [Latin America] took inventories to levels that would already keep grain prices high,\"\" wrote the Morgan Stanley analysts in a report. \"\"The war adds uncertainties related to Ukrainian corn/wheat supply, and, more important to fertilizer use and global yields,\"\" they said. \"\"Due to this, our base crop price scenario implies a 2-3% reduction of yields in higher-cost regions, with risks of larger disruptions depending on fertilizer availability and weather.\"\" The Morgan Stanley analysts said they expect higher prices in 2022 and 2023, but after that they expect inventories should normalize with more supply from Latin America. They also anticipate prices will align closer with production costs and drop 15% to 20% below longer-term soy and corn contracts. Zoom In IconArrows pointing outwards Melek said corn rose 57% in 2021, and it could be volatile this year, averaging up 25% higher on the year. Live cattle prices rose 19% last year and could gain another 15% in 2022. Wheat was up 27% in 2021 and could tack on another 22% this year, he said. Melek said the high prices are being driven by tight supplies and shortages. \"\"We're talking about an erosion of food security on a scale we have not seen for a long time, and I think it will touch people in the lower income distribution in North America,\"\" he added. Melek said farmers are likely to consider rotating in less fertilizer-intensive corps and will economize on the amount of nutrients they use. \"\"Consumers are going to make choices too,\"\" he said. Fertilizer production relies on natural gas, and that has made a difference to U.S. producers. The biggest buyers of the top three types of fertilizers are Brazil, India, the U.S. and China, according to Morgan Stanley. \"\"Being a North American producer is huge for us. We pay somewhere in the neighborhood of $5 to $6 per million British thermal unit [MMBtu] of natural gas,\"\" CF's Will said. \"\"Europe pays $35 to $38 per MMBtu\u2026That is a huge spread between low cost production, and it's one of the reasons why fertilizer price is what it is. It's not only a lack of availability, but the high-cost producers are very high cost.\"\" For some farmers, the high-priced or unavailable fertilizer will mean crops may not get as much nourishment this year. In turn, yields could be lower. \"\"In close contact with a number of our customers in Latin America, we're going to begin exporting on a humanitarian basis just to get nutrients down there to a region that is a rich growing area but also starved for nutrients right now,\"\" said CF's Will.

But the good news may end there. On average, there were about 500 reports of unruly passengers per month in 2021, according to the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration. In the first three months of 2022, this number fell to about 350 reports per month, according to FAA statistics. That's progress, especially considering that there are far more flights than in early 2021, when incident reports reached an all-time peak. However, it's still a far cry from the number of in-flight outbursts logged before the pandemic, which from 2014 to 2019 happened about 10 times a month, according to CNBC's calculations. \u00a0 Why unruliness skyrocketed In 2021, nearly 3 out of 4 unruly passenger reports were related to mask compliance, according to the FAA, which monitors flights that depart from or arrive in the United States. For some, refusing to wear a mask became both a political statement and a marker of personal autonomy, said Sharona Hoffman, co-director of the Law-Medicine Center at Case Western Reserve University School of Law. Many of these people do not want to be told what to do, and flying is \"\"an environment where they are told what to do \u2014 all the time \u2014 for hours.\"\" People are used to thinking they'll get an exception. Sharona Hoffman Case Western Reserve University School of Law. Rage in the not-so-friendly skies is also a manifestation of anger happening on the ground, she said. For every video of an airline passenger losing it on a flight, there are others at grocery stories, school board meetings and banks. Covid measures have added to the stress of flying, said Hoffman. Meals, drinks and snacks were taken away at one point, \"\"so all the things that used to distract and entertain people were removed,\"\" she said. Bryan Del Monte, president of The Aviation Agency, a marketing company for the aviation industry, agreed stress may be behind the increase in unruly behavior. \u00a0\u00a0 \"\"However, I'm under a fair amount of stress and somehow, I don't go bananas on an airplane, punch out the flight attendant \u2026 while 20-30 people film it,\"\" he said. Why people continue to act out Threatening or interfering with the duties of a crewmember can result in fines, flight bans, federal criminal charges and jail time. With most passengers armed with video cameras on their phones, there's also the risk of becoming the unwitting star of a viral video, which can \u2014 and has \u2014 led to job terminations and deportations. \u00a0 But what's a devastating public tantrum to one person may be an act of gallantry to another, said Hoffman, citing those who many want to be a \"\"hero for anti-mask advocates.\"\" \u00a0 The Aviation Agency's Del Monte said people throw tantrum on flights \"\"because they feel they can \u2026 We have a place for people who believe they can do whatever they want when they want. It's called prison.\"\" Ems-forster-productions | Digitalvision | Getty Images Others don't feel the rules apply to them, said Hoffman, adding that \"\"people are used to thinking they'll get an exception,\"\" which may have been the case for them with vaccine mandates. Hoffman said although a lot is at stake for bad behavior aboard commercial flights, \"\"people commit crimes all the time.\"\" Most don't think they'll get caught or punished, she said. Few face the music They could be right. Of the 1,091 unruly passenger reports this year, fewer than 30% have been investigated and just 15% have resulted in \"\"enforcement action,\"\" according to the FAA . Still, that's higher than the 6% of reports that resulted in enforcement action in 2021, said Del Monte. \"\"Enforcement action\"\" now means proposed fines, an FAA spokesperson told CNBC. In the past, it included warnings and counseling, but that ended under the FAA's \"\"zero tolerance\"\" policy which started in January 2021. \"\"Fining these people is obviously not a deterrent. ... They're judgment proof. Bryan Del Monte President of The Aviation Agency Maximum fines have increased too \u2014 from $25,000 to $37,000 per violation \u2014 and one incident can result in multiple violations, according to the FAA. But this isn't enough, said Del Monte, who said much more should be done. \"\"Fining these people is obviously not a deterrent,\"\" he said. \"\"Most [of] them \u2014 $300, $3,000, $30,000 or $3 million \u2014 it wouldn't matter. They're judgment proof.\"\" Even fewer people face criminal proceedings, he said. The FAA, which lacks criminal prosecutorial authority, said it referred 37 unruly passengers to the FBI last November.\u00a0Later that month, Attorney General Merrick Garland directed U.S. attorneys to prioritize the prosecution of federal crimes on commercial aircraft .

In the letter, Bastian said Delta has banned at least 1,900 for mask-related issues alone , as well as increased self-defense training for flight attendants and front-line employees. Will bad behavior end soon? Since most problems are related to masks, unruly passenger reports will likely drop once mask mandates end, said Del Monte. Masks are no longer required on several major European airlines and could end in the United States on April 18, when the federal mandate expires. Asia, on the other hand, is expected to keep mandates in place longer. News of unruly flyers in the region remains scarce thanks in part to a culture of mask-wearing that predates the pandemic. Yet even with mandates gone, incidents aren't likely to return to pre-pandemic numbers, said Del Monte. The FAA said it proposed $5 million in fines against unruly passengers in 2021. Lindsey Nicholson | Universal Images Group | Getty Images About 28% of U.S. unruly passenger reports in 2021 were not related to masks, according to the FAA. Ignoring mask-related incidents altogether, unruly passenger incidents still increased some 1,300% last year compared with the five years before the pandemic, according to CNBC's calculations. The most violent onboard attacks \"\"have nothing to do with masks,\"\" said Sara Nelson, president of the Association of Flight Attendants-CWA in a statement published Feb.15 in support of a centralized list of banned passengers shared between airlines. Still, Del Monte said, the problem isn't likely to go away soon. \u00a0 \"\"I doubt sincerely \u2026 the ignoramus sod who is suddenly an expert on both epidemiology and the rule of law will be placated by lack of a mask,\"\" he said. \"\"That person will undoubtedly find some other small injustice to create the conditions he'll wind up fined or imprisoned over.\"\" Plus, airlines may have to contend with another mask problem then \u2014 the \"\"radicalization\"\" of flyers who want the mandates to continue. \"\"They may replace those who refuse to wear a mask as being unruly,\"\" he said. \u00a0 ", "polarity": 0.025108082706766933, "subjectivity": 0.4170050125313282}], "extractedSentences": [{"articlIdOfReferencedSentence": 107042478, "sentenceText": "Read more \u2018Air rage\u2019 is complicating travel in North America and Europe \u2013 but not so much in Asia \"\"That's when we started seeing people get referred for criminal prosecution,\"\" he said. \"\"A few high profile cases where these criminals wind up doing 60 months somewhere would put the word out that this is not acceptable.\"\" Del Monte said he supports Delta Air Lines CEO Ed Bastian's call for a national \"\"no-fly\"\" list in a letter to Garland in February.

We are bullish on both EV and EUV,\"\" Steve Majoros, vice president of Chevrolet marketing, told media Wednesday. The automaker restarted production and shipments of the Bolt EV and a larger \"\"EUV\"\" version this week. Production of the vehicles at a plant in Michigan had largely been down since August, when the automaker recalled every Bolt that had been produced at the factory since 2016. The recall followed the Detroit automaker determining two \"\"rare manufacturing defects\"\" in the lithium-ion battery cells of the vehicle's battery pack could cause a fire. GM is aware of 19 vehicle fires related to the problem, a spokesman said. The fires and recall were a major setback for the automaker in terms of EV sales and its reputation, despite its battery supplier, an LG company, taking blame for the issues. The Vermont State Police released this photo of the 2019 Chevrolet Bolt EV that caught fire on July 1, 2021 in the driveway of state Rep. Timothy Briglin, a Democrat.

The News with Shepard Smith Leading U.S. scientists and physicians worry that the FDA and CDC are moving too fast in approving a fourth round of Covid shots, with little public debate that gives the vaccine makers too big a role in setting the pace with which the doses are distributed across the nation. The top U.S. public health agencies last week endorsed a fourth Covid shot for older adults without holding public meetings, drawing criticism from leading vaccine experts who believe federal health officials haven't provided enough transparency about the reasons for the decision. Cathy Dozal gets her second booster shot against COVID-19 from Vocational nursing student, Patricia Lizardo, at Long Beach City College in Long Beach on Wednesday, March 30, 2022. Brittany Murray | Medianews Group | Getty Images The authorization of a fourth dose for adults age 50 and older comes as the scientific community is divided over whether the data is sufficient to support another round of boosters, and whether authorizing additional shots is a sustainable public health policy, especially since protection against infection simply wears off over time. There is a debate over whether the goal of the vaccines is to prevent severe illness, which they've largely achieved, or infection as well \u2014 a more challenging proposition. The Food and Drug Administration authorized a second booster shot for people age 50 and older last week, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention quickly backed their distribution hours later based on data from Israel, which rolled out fourth doses months ago. Dr. Peter Marks, who heads the FDA office responsible for vaccine safety and efficacy, said shortly after the decision that another round of boosters will likely be needed in the fall. Rapid approval The rapid regulatory clearance of fourth shots for older adults came just weeks after Pfizer and Moderna asked the FDA to permit them. Several FDA and CDC committee members as well as other leading experts said Pfizer and Moderna are playing too large a role in setting the agenda around U.S. vaccine policy by announcing the need for fourth doses and possibly a variant-specific vaccine before the public health agencies have made any recommendations. Moderna CEO Stephane Bancel said during a January interview with Goldman Sachs that fourth doses would be needed in the fall as the protective antibodies from the shots wane over time. Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla told CNBC in early March, before the company filed its request with the FDA, that there's a need for a fourth dose though he said the regulators would ultimately come to their own conclusion. \"\"I just think it's sort of booster mania. I think the companies are frankly acting like public health agencies,\"\" said Dr. Paul Offit, a member of the FDA committee and one of the nation's top vaccine experts. Offit said the CDC, which has the final say on vaccine recommendations, needs to develop a clear national strategy to reduce public confusion about what it means to be fully vaccinated at this stage in the Covid pandemic . Michael Osterholm, a leading epidemiologist, said repeated boosting is not a sustainable public health strategy because of the challenge posed by waning immunity against infection. \"\"We're not gonna be able to boost our way out of this,\"\" said Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota. Call for more transparency The FDA and CDC vaccine advisory panels weigh safety and efficacy data before making recommendations to top federal health officials on the best path forward. Though the recommendations are nonbinding, the meetings provide an open forum where the public can listen to the nation's top health experts debate the pros and cons of vaccine policy, and often even participate by phoning in to voice their views. The FDA's Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee is meeting Wednesday to debate the future of boosters. However, it will not vote on any specific recommendations, according to the FDA. The CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices did not meet before CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky signed off on the fourth shots for older adults last week. \"\"It's just sort of fait accompli,\"\" Offit said. \"\"I feel that we're in a time, this sort of Covid exceptionalism, where we don't do things the way we normally do it, which is that the science precedes the recommendation. Here, it's the other way around,\"\" he said. Offit said that the FDA is effectively asking the public to believe that the data supports a fourth dose by providing sufficient protection against serious illness. He said the American public benefits from hearing an open discussion about vaccine decisions, particularly at a time when many people are not taking advantage of the third dose. Offit is an infectious disease expert at Children's Hospital Philadelphia and a co-inventor of a rotavirus vaccine. VIDEO 1:45 01:45 FDA authorizes fourth Covid vaccine dose for people age 50 and older Squawk on the Street Marks, during a call with reporters last week, said the FDA did not call a committee meeting because the decision was \"\"relatively straightforward.\"\" He said data from Israel suggested a fourth dose can reduce the risk of hospitalization and death in older adults. The CDC, in a statement to CNBC, said the fourth dose was an incremental change that did not need to go before its committee. Dr. William Schaffner, a nonvoting member of ACIP, disagreed that the CDC recommendation was an incremental change. Schaffner said clearing fourth doses for older adults is a big decision that would have benefited from a meeting of outside advisors to provide the public with transparency. \"\"I think to have this decision made in-house behind closed doors without having the transparency of a full debate that a regularly called ACIP meeting would have provided \u2013 I think that's unfortunate,\"\" said Schaffner, an infectious disease expert at Vanderbilt University Medical Center. Dr. James Hildreth, who is attending the FDA committee's Wednesday meeting as a temporary member, noted that the drug regulator wasn't required to call a public meeting before authorizing the shots, and the agency has seasoned experts who can determine if there is evidence to support a new authorization. However, Hildreth said moving forward without a recommendation from outside experts fuels the perception that industry is playing too big a role in the nation's vaccine strategy. \"\"When the FDA makes a decision like that without calling together an outside group of experts, it just adds to the optics of the pharmaceutical companies having an impact on decisions that are being made,\"\" said Hildreth, president of Meharry Medical College in Nashville, Tennessee. Meharry is a clinical trial site for Novavax's vaccine as well as Moderna's shots for younger children. CNBC Health &amp; Science Read CNBC's latest global coverage of the Covid pandemic: FDA authorizes fourth Pfizer Covid vaccine dose for people age 50 and older Omicron BA.2 subvariant will soon dominate in U.S., but Fauci doesn\u2019t expect another surge UnitedHealth to buy LHC Group for $5.4 billion Moderna Covid vaccine for kids under 6 years old was up to 44% effective against omicron infection Omicron's 'stealth' subvariant BA.2 could go 'wild' in Europe before going global, top epidemiologist says FDA advisory committee to discuss future of Covid boosters 'Diminishing returns' While some health experts believe the central purposes of the vaccines is to prevent severe illness, others think it is important to also stop infections from the virus. The protection provided by the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines against infection has declined substantially over time, particularly in the context of omicron, which has numerous mutations that give it an enhanced capability to cause breakthrough infections and mild illness. However, the vaccines are still providing substantial protection against severe illness. \"\"If you've gotten a mild illness after you've been vaccinated, you've won \u2014 that's it. You've been prevented from having serious illness, which is the stated goal of this vaccine,\"\" said Offit, who believes three doses were necessary for the elderly and four for the people with weak immune systems, but is skeptical of the need for additional shots right now. But if the goal is also to prevent infection, that means, at least for now, booster shots are the only available tool to increase antibodies until a longer-lasting vaccine is available. The problem is that the vaccines eventually run into diminishing returns, according John Moore, \u00a0a professor of microbiology and immunology at Weill Cornell Medical College. Moore said a three-dose regimen is fairly standard with vaccines to help boost the immune system to its peak response. A fourth shot, however, begins to hit a ceiling \u2014 at least in terms of protecting younger people against infection. The Israeli Health Ministry and scientists at Sheba Medical Center found that a fourth dose does restore antibodies that waned off after a third dose among health-care workers ages 18 and older, but it provided little protection against infection. Pfizer cited that study, which has not undergone peer-review, among others in its statement on the FDA authorization, focusing on the increased antibodies without highlighting the issues with breakthrough infections. Different age, different needs Dr. Peter Hotez, a vaccine expert at the Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, strongly supports a fourth dose for older adults, pointing to a CDC study from February that found the third shot's effectiveness against hospitalization dropped from 91% to 78% after four months. Pfizer, in its public statements on the fourth dose, cited a separate Israeli study that found a fourth dose reduced mortality by 78% in people ages 60 and over. The study from Ben Gurion University and Clalit Health Services, which has not undergone peer-review, analyzed the medical records of more than 500,000 people. 'We continue to collect and assess all available data and remain in open dialogue with regulators and health authorities to help inform a Covid-19 vaccine strategy as the virus evolves,\"\" Pfizer said in a statement to CNBC. While the Ben Gurion study may point in the direction of a benefit for older adults at the moment, the evidence for boosting younger adults again is scant as the U.S. considers lowering the eligibility for fourth doses sometime later in the year. VIDEO 1:59 01:59 Moderna CEO Stephane Bancel on fourth Covid vaccine dose, BA.2 omicron variant Squawk Box Dr. Gili Regev-Yochay and her team of scientists at Sheba said a fourth dose \"\"may only have marginal benefits\"\" for younger people, according to a letter published in the New England Journal of Medicine. While Pfizer originally filed for adults age 65 and older, Moderna asked the FDA authorize a fourth dose for ages 18 and older. Moore called Moderna's filing \"\"aggressive,\"\" arguing that it didn't distinguish between the needs of the elderly, who may benefit from an additional dose, compared with younger adults where the data is less convincing. Moderna CEO Bancel told CNBC last month that the company wanted to give the FDA flexibility to decide which age group would benefit most from a fourth shot right now. Moderna, in its public statements on its application for a fourth dose, pointed to data from Israel but didn't cite specific studies. Though Hotez supports a fourth dose for older adults, he said the FDA and the CDC have not done an effective job at communicating whether the goal of the vaccines is to prevent severe illness, infection or both, and the vaccines makers have filled that void with statements on data from their clinical trials and lab studies. Hotez and a team of scientists in Texas developed a Covid vaccine, Corbevax, based on traditional protein-based technology that has received authorization in India. Hotez also expressed frustration that the U.S. relies heavily on data from abroad, particularly Israel and the U.K. Offit also questioned why the U.S. is relying on data from countries that are smaller than the U.S. and have different demographic backgrounds. Long-term strategy needed Hildreth said the U.S. should put off additional booster doses as long as the public health situation allows so the nation can more clearly define how it measures protection against the virus and develop a long-term strategy to achieve that end. He said if the public is asked to get boosted every several months, many people will simply stop listening. \"\"We don't know a specific measure we can do to say whether or not a person is truly protected, and whether or that's the same with everybody,\"\" said Hildreth. For example, there's no clear measure of whether a certain level of antibodies is sufficient to protect people, he said. Beyond vaccination with the current vaccines, Pfizer and Moderna are developing shots that target omicron as well as other variants. Dr. Arnold Monto, who is chairing the FDA's committee meeting on booster strategy Wednesday, said public health authorities need to develop a consensus about what goes into the vaccines moving forward. Monto said collaboration between the vaccine makers and the government is crucial, but industry has started playing a larger public role in decisions about about what kind of vaccines should be developed to target specific Covid variants. \"\"Industry has a double-headed goal. They are trying to do public good like we all are. They also have stockholders, and we need to be sure that the public health good is kept mind,\"\" Monto said.

Officials \"\"generally agreed\"\" that a maximum of $60 billion in Treasurys and $35 billion in mortgage-backed securities would be allowed to roll off, phased in over three months and likely starting in May.\u00a0 The news sent the blue-chip Dow down more than 100 points Wednesday, while the S&amp;P 500 slid 1%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite dropped another 2.2%, bringing its week-to-date losses to 2.6%. Those losses came after comments from Fed Governor Lael Brainard pushed stock prices lower on Tuesday . \"\"It does seem like they are talking up the possibility of raising rates by 50 basis points at the next meeting so the hope is that message is well telegraphed in advance,\"\" said Brian Price, head of investment management at Commonwealth Financial Network. \"\"I expect that volatility will remain elevated for the time being as there is a lot of uncertainty for investors to digest right now.\"\"\u00a0 \u00a0 Investors await the weekly jobless claims data Thursday morning, which is expected to show a total of 200,000 claims filed. Investors also continue to monitor the Ukraine-Russia war, as Ukraine asks NATO for more weapons. \"\"Ukraine's urgent needs, the sustainability of supplies, and long-term solutions which will help Ukraine to prevail,\"\" Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said in a tweet.

Bloomberg | Getty Images LONDON \u2014 A new omicron subvariant has been detected in the U.K. as the country faces a renewed surge in Covid-19 hospitalizations. The XE variant, as it is known, has so far been detected in 637 patients nationwide, according to the latest statistics from the U.K. Health Security Agency , which said there is currently not enough evidence to draw conclusions on its transmissibility or severity. VIDEO 1:01 01:01 Bipartisan group of senators strike new $10B Covid relief deal The News with Shepard Smith XE contains a mix of the previously highly infectious omicron BA.1 strain, which emerged in late 2021, and the newer \"\"stealth\"\" BA.2 variant, currently the U.K.'s dominant variant. It is what's known as a \"\"recombinant,\"\" a type of variant that can occur when an individual becomes infected with two or more variants at the same time, resulting in a mixing of their genetic material within a patient's body. XE's transmissibility, severity not yet conclusive Such recombinants are not uncommon, having occurred several times during the coronavirus pandemic . Data on the new variant's severity and ability to evade vaccines is not yet clear, though early estimates suggest it could be more transmissible than earlier strains. UKHSA data shows XE has a growth rate of 9.8% above that of BA.2, while the World Health Organization has so far put that figure at 10%. Health authorities have said they are continuing to monitor the situation. \"\"This particular recombinant, XE, has shown a variable growth rate and we cannot yet confirm whether it has a true growth advantage. So far there is not enough evidence to draw conclusions about transmissibility, severity or vaccine effectiveness,\"\" UKHSA's chief medical advisor, professor Susan Hopkins, said. The earliest confirmed XE case in Britain has a specimen date of Jan. 19 of this year, suggesting it could have been in circulation in the population for several months. It has also been detected beyond the U.K. in Thailand. Surging cases It comes as the U.K. faces a new surge in infections. Still, the XE variant currently accounts for less than 1% of total Covid cases that have undergone genomic sequencing there. According to the Office for National Statistics, 4.9 million people in Britain, or 1 in 13, were infected with Covid as of March 26 \u2014 a record high since its survey began in April 2020. Hospitalizations, meanwhile, have risen more than 7% in the last week to over 16,500 . Older adults have proven particularly susceptible to the latest wave amid waning booster immunity and easing Covid restrictions. According to Imperial College's latest React study , an estimated 8.31% of the over-55 age group tested positive as of the end of March \u2014 nearly 20 times the average prevalence recorded since the survey started in May 2020. Cases among children and younger adults, meanwhile, appear to be plateauing. The findings mark the 19th and final round of the study as Covid restrictions and surveillance systems are unwound in the U.K. and beyond.

The News with Shepard Smith Leading U.S. scientists and physicians worry that the FDA and CDC are moving too fast in approving a fourth round of Covid shots, with little public debate that gives the vaccine makers too big a role in setting the pace with which the doses are distributed across the nation. The top U.S. public health agencies last week endorsed a fourth Covid shot for older adults without holding public meetings, drawing criticism from leading vaccine experts who believe federal health officials haven't provided enough transparency about the reasons for the decision. Cathy Dozal gets her second booster shot against COVID-19 from Vocational nursing student, Patricia Lizardo, at Long Beach City College in Long Beach on Wednesday, March 30, 2022. Brittany Murray | Medianews Group | Getty Images The authorization of a fourth dose for adults age 50 and older comes as the scientific community is divided over whether the data is sufficient to support another round of boosters, and whether authorizing additional shots is a sustainable public health policy, especially since protection against infection simply wears off over time. There is a debate over whether the goal of the vaccines is to prevent severe illness, which they've largely achieved, or infection as well \u2014 a more challenging proposition. The Food and Drug Administration authorized a second booster shot for people age 50 and older last week, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention quickly backed their distribution hours later based on data from Israel, which rolled out fourth doses months ago. Dr. Peter Marks, who heads the FDA office responsible for vaccine safety and efficacy, said shortly after the decision that another round of boosters will likely be needed in the fall. Rapid approval The rapid regulatory clearance of fourth shots for older adults came just weeks after Pfizer and Moderna asked the FDA to permit them. Several FDA and CDC committee members as well as other leading experts said Pfizer and Moderna are playing too large a role in setting the agenda around U.S. vaccine policy by announcing the need for fourth doses and possibly a variant-specific vaccine before the public health agencies have made any recommendations. Moderna CEO Stephane Bancel said during a January interview with Goldman Sachs that fourth doses would be needed in the fall as the protective antibodies from the shots wane over time. Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla told CNBC in early March, before the company filed its request with the FDA, that there's a need for a fourth dose though he said the regulators would ultimately come to their own conclusion. \"\"I just think it's sort of booster mania. I think the companies are frankly acting like public health agencies,\"\" said Dr. Paul Offit, a member of the FDA committee and one of the nation's top vaccine experts. Offit said the CDC, which has the final say on vaccine recommendations, needs to develop a clear national strategy to reduce public confusion about what it means to be fully vaccinated at this stage in the Covid pandemic . Michael Osterholm, a leading epidemiologist, said repeated boosting is not a sustainable public health strategy because of the challenge posed by waning immunity against infection. \"\"We're not gonna be able to boost our way out of this,\"\" said Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota. Call for more transparency The FDA and CDC vaccine advisory panels weigh safety and efficacy data before making recommendations to top federal health officials on the best path forward. Though the recommendations are nonbinding, the meetings provide an open forum where the public can listen to the nation's top health experts debate the pros and cons of vaccine policy, and often even participate by phoning in to voice their views. The FDA's Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee is meeting Wednesday to debate the future of boosters. However, it will not vote on any specific recommendations, according to the FDA. The CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices did not meet before CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky signed off on the fourth shots for older adults last week. \"\"It's just sort of fait accompli,\"\" Offit said. \"\"I feel that we're in a time, this sort of Covid exceptionalism, where we don't do things the way we normally do it, which is that the science precedes the recommendation. Here, it's the other way around,\"\" he said. Offit said that the FDA is effectively asking the public to believe that the data supports a fourth dose by providing sufficient protection against serious illness. He said the American public benefits from hearing an open discussion about vaccine decisions, particularly at a time when many people are not taking advantage of the third dose. Offit is an infectious disease expert at Children's Hospital Philadelphia and a co-inventor of a rotavirus vaccine. VIDEO 1:45 01:45 FDA authorizes fourth Covid vaccine dose for people age 50 and older Squawk on the Street Marks, during a call with reporters last week, said the FDA did not call a committee meeting because the decision was \"\"relatively straightforward.\"\" He said data from Israel suggested a fourth dose can reduce the risk of hospitalization and death in older adults. The CDC, in a statement to CNBC, said the fourth dose was an incremental change that did not need to go before its committee. Dr. William Schaffner, a nonvoting member of ACIP, disagreed that the CDC recommendation was an incremental change. Schaffner said clearing fourth doses for older adults is a big decision that would have benefited from a meeting of outside advisors to provide the public with transparency. \"\"I think to have this decision made in-house behind closed doors without having the transparency of a full debate that a regularly called ACIP meeting would have provided \u2013 I think that's unfortunate,\"\" said Schaffner, an infectious disease expert at Vanderbilt University Medical Center. Dr. James Hildreth, who is attending the FDA committee's Wednesday meeting as a temporary member, noted that the drug regulator wasn't required to call a public meeting before authorizing the shots, and the agency has seasoned experts who can determine if there is evidence to support a new authorization. However, Hildreth said moving forward without a recommendation from outside experts fuels the perception that industry is playing too big a role in the nation's vaccine strategy. \"\"When the FDA makes a decision like that without calling together an outside group of experts, it just adds to the optics of the pharmaceutical companies having an impact on decisions that are being made,\"\" said Hildreth, president of Meharry Medical College in Nashville, Tennessee. Meharry is a clinical trial site for Novavax's vaccine as well as Moderna's shots for younger children. CNBC Health &amp; Science Read CNBC's latest global coverage of the Covid pandemic: FDA authorizes fourth Pfizer Covid vaccine dose for people age 50 and older Omicron BA.2 subvariant will soon dominate in U.S., but Fauci doesn\u2019t expect another surge UnitedHealth to buy LHC Group for $5.4 billion Moderna Covid vaccine for kids under 6 years old was up to 44% effective against omicron infection Omicron's 'stealth' subvariant BA.2 could go 'wild' in Europe before going global, top epidemiologist says FDA advisory committee to discuss future of Covid boosters 'Diminishing returns' While some health experts believe the central purposes of the vaccines is to prevent severe illness, others think it is important to also stop infections from the virus. The protection provided by the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines against infection has declined substantially over time, particularly in the context of omicron, which has numerous mutations that give it an enhanced capability to cause breakthrough infections and mild illness. However, the vaccines are still providing substantial protection against severe illness. \"\"If you've gotten a mild illness after you've been vaccinated, you've won \u2014 that's it. You've been prevented from having serious illness, which is the stated goal of this vaccine,\"\" said Offit, who believes three doses were necessary for the elderly and four for the people with weak immune systems, but is skeptical of the need for additional shots right now. But if the goal is also to prevent infection, that means, at least for now, booster shots are the only available tool to increase antibodies until a longer-lasting vaccine is available. The problem is that the vaccines eventually run into diminishing returns, according John Moore, \u00a0a professor of microbiology and immunology at Weill Cornell Medical College. Moore said a three-dose regimen is fairly standard with vaccines to help boost the immune system to its peak response. A fourth shot, however, begins to hit a ceiling \u2014 at least in terms of protecting younger people against infection. The Israeli Health Ministry and scientists at Sheba Medical Center found that a fourth dose does restore antibodies that waned off after a third dose among health-care workers ages 18 and older, but it provided little protection against infection. Pfizer cited that study, which has not undergone peer-review, among others in its statement on the FDA authorization, focusing on the increased antibodies without highlighting the issues with breakthrough infections. Different age, different needs Dr. Peter Hotez, a vaccine expert at the Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, strongly supports a fourth dose for older adults, pointing to a CDC study from February that found the third shot's effectiveness against hospitalization dropped from 91% to 78% after four months. Pfizer, in its public statements on the fourth dose, cited a separate Israeli study that found a fourth dose reduced mortality by 78% in people ages 60 and over. The study from Ben Gurion University and Clalit Health Services, which has not undergone peer-review, analyzed the medical records of more than 500,000 people. 'We continue to collect and assess all available data and remain in open dialogue with regulators and health authorities to help inform a Covid-19 vaccine strategy as the virus evolves,\"\" Pfizer said in a statement to CNBC. While the Ben Gurion study may point in the direction of a benefit for older adults at the moment, the evidence for boosting younger adults again is scant as the U.S. considers lowering the eligibility for fourth doses sometime later in the year. VIDEO 1:59 01:59 Moderna CEO Stephane Bancel on fourth Covid vaccine dose, BA.2 omicron variant Squawk Box Dr. Gili Regev-Yochay and her team of scientists at Sheba said a fourth dose \"\"may only have marginal benefits\"\" for younger people, according to a letter published in the New England Journal of Medicine. While Pfizer originally filed for adults age 65 and older, Moderna asked the FDA authorize a fourth dose for ages 18 and older. Moore called Moderna's filing \"\"aggressive,\"\" arguing that it didn't distinguish between the needs of the elderly, who may benefit from an additional dose, compared with younger adults where the data is less convincing. Moderna CEO Bancel told CNBC last month that the company wanted to give the FDA flexibility to decide which age group would benefit most from a fourth shot right now. Moderna, in its public statements on its application for a fourth dose, pointed to data from Israel but didn't cite specific studies. Though Hotez supports a fourth dose for older adults, he said the FDA and the CDC have not done an effective job at communicating whether the goal of the vaccines is to prevent severe illness, infection or both, and the vaccines makers have filled that void with statements on data from their clinical trials and lab studies. Hotez and a team of scientists in Texas developed a Covid vaccine, Corbevax, based on traditional protein-based technology that has received authorization in India. Hotez also expressed frustration that the U.S. relies heavily on data from abroad, particularly Israel and the U.K. Offit also questioned why the U.S. is relying on data from countries that are smaller than the U.S. and have different demographic backgrounds. Long-term strategy needed Hildreth said the U.S. should put off additional booster doses as long as the public health situation allows so the nation can more clearly define how it measures protection against the virus and develop a long-term strategy to achieve that end. He said if the public is asked to get boosted every several months, many people will simply stop listening. \"\"We don't know a specific measure we can do to say whether or not a person is truly protected, and whether or that's the same with everybody,\"\" said Hildreth. For example, there's no clear measure of whether a certain level of antibodies is sufficient to protect people, he said. Beyond vaccination with the current vaccines, Pfizer and Moderna are developing shots that target omicron as well as other variants. Dr. Arnold Monto, who is chairing the FDA's committee meeting on booster strategy Wednesday, said public health authorities need to develop a consensus about what goes into the vaccines moving forward. Monto said collaboration between the vaccine makers and the government is crucial, but industry has started playing a larger public role in decisions about about what kind of vaccines should be developed to target specific Covid variants. \"\"Industry has a double-headed goal. They are trying to do public good like we all are. They also have stockholders, and we need to be sure that the public health good is kept mind,\"\" Monto said.

High grain prices are rising even more.\u00a0 VIDEO 3:53 03:53 The global shortage of fertilizer is a huge problem, says CF Industries Holdings CEO Closing Bell \"\"It is a huge problem,\"\" said CF Industries CEO Tony Will in a recent CNBC appearance. He said global fertilizer supplies are very tight. CF manufactures and distributes fertilizers. \"\"It's a confluence of factors, unprecedented demand coupled with a huge fall off in supply availability, only just exacerbated by the war in Ukraine and what's going on with exports coming out of Russia and Ukraine,\"\" Will added. A contributor to higher costs and shortages \"\"All of this is a double whammy, if not a triple whammy,\"\" said Bart Melek, global head of commodity strategy at TD Securities. \"\"We have geopolitical risk, higher input costs and basically shortages.\"\"\u00a0 \"\"Agriculture is absolutely going to get hit. In the case of Canada, it's good for Saskatchewan, which is the largest producer of potash in the world, but farmers are going to get hurt because per acre they're going to pay a lot more,\"\" Melek said. \"\"They're going to get lower yield simply because they're economizing, particularly in emerging markets.\"\" Grain shortages will drive up the cost of basic foods and other commodities. \"\"That's going to lead to higher input costs for producing everything from grains, wheat and corn. The input costs are higher now because you're going to have scarcity that bids the price up as well,\"\" Melek said. Meanwhile, prices for cows, steers and pork bellies have also climbed significantly, he added. VIDEO 2:33 02:33 We're not just concerned about food prices but also availability, says Ospraie's Anderson Halftime Report Some fertilizers have more than doubled in price. For instance, Melek said potash traded in Vancouver was priced at about $210 per metric tons at the beginning of 2021, and it's now valued at $565. He added that urea for delivery to the Middle East was trading at $268 per metric ton on the Chicago Board of Trade in early 2021 and was valued at $887.50 on Tuesday. Will said CF Industries is running its plants around the clock, foregoing some maintenance and trying to expedite shipments to areas in need. \"\"There are no new tons to make. It's just a matter of trying to get them there as quickly as we can into the marketplace,\"\" he said. Just as the price of fertilizers has jumped, the price of agricultural commodities has also been soaring, amid fears of shortages. \"\"We are absolutely facing a problem of catastrophic proportion here,\"\" said Will. \"\"Not only is the issue lack of availability and affordability of nutrients and inputs, but Russia and Ukraine have historically exported about 30% of the global wheat trade and 20% of global corn trade.\"\" He added that there are stocks of those commodities that are not getting out to the market because the Black Sea is closed. Rising prices for wheat, corn and soy Wheat futures for July were down slightly Wednesday. They rose about 4% Tuesday on worries about Ukraine but also on worse-than-expected U.S. crop conditions. Corn futures prices are up nearly 30% year-to-date and inched downward Wednesday on the Chicago Board of Trade. Soybean futures were also slightly lower. Morgan Stanley expects grain prices to remain above last year's levels until 2023. \"\"Before the Ukraine war, the dry weather in [Latin America] took inventories to levels that would already keep grain prices high,\"\" wrote the Morgan Stanley analysts in a report. \"\"The war adds uncertainties related to Ukrainian corn/wheat supply, and, more important to fertilizer use and global yields,\"\" they said. \"\"Due to this, our base crop price scenario implies a 2-3% reduction of yields in higher-cost regions, with risks of larger disruptions depending on fertilizer availability and weather.\"\" The Morgan Stanley analysts said they expect higher prices in 2022 and 2023, but after that they expect inventories should normalize with more supply from Latin America. They also anticipate prices will align closer with production costs and drop 15% to 20% below longer-term soy and corn contracts. Zoom In IconArrows pointing outwards Melek said corn rose 57% in 2021, and it could be volatile this year, averaging up 25% higher on the year. Live cattle prices rose 19% last year and could gain another 15% in 2022. Wheat was up 27% in 2021 and could tack on another 22% this year, he said. Melek said the high prices are being driven by tight supplies and shortages. \"\"We're talking about an erosion of food security on a scale we have not seen for a long time, and I think it will touch people in the lower income distribution in North America,\"\" he added. Melek said farmers are likely to consider rotating in less fertilizer-intensive corps and will economize on the amount of nutrients they use. \"\"Consumers are going to make choices too,\"\" he said. Fertilizer production relies on natural gas, and that has made a difference to U.S. producers. The biggest buyers of the top three types of fertilizers are Brazil, India, the U.S. and China, according to Morgan Stanley. \"\"Being a North American producer is huge for us. We pay somewhere in the neighborhood of $5 to $6 per million British thermal unit [MMBtu] of natural gas,\"\" CF's Will said. \"\"Europe pays $35 to $38 per MMBtu\u2026That is a huge spread between low cost production, and it's one of the reasons why fertilizer price is what it is. It's not only a lack of availability, but the high-cost producers are very high cost.\"\" For some farmers, the high-priced or unavailable fertilizer will mean crops may not get as much nourishment this year. In turn, yields could be lower. \"\"In close contact with a number of our customers in Latin America, we're going to begin exporting on a humanitarian basis just to get nutrients down there to a region that is a rich growing area but also starved for nutrients right now,\"\" said CF's Will.

It is what's known as a \"\"recombinant,\"\" a type of variant that can occur when an individual becomes infected with two or more variants at the same time, resulting in a mixing of their genetic material within a patient's body. XE's transmissibility, severity not yet conclusive Such recombinants are not uncommon, having occurred several times during the coronavirus pandemic . Data on the new variant's severity and ability to evade vaccines is not yet clear, though early estimates suggest it could be more transmissible than earlier strains. UKHSA data shows XE has a growth rate of 9.8% above that of BA.2, while the World Health Organization has so far put that figure at 10%. Health authorities have said they are continuing to monitor the situation. \"\"This particular recombinant, XE, has shown a variable growth rate and we cannot yet confirm whether it has a true growth advantage. So far there is not enough evidence to draw conclusions about transmissibility, severity or vaccine effectiveness,\"\" UKHSA's chief medical advisor, professor Susan Hopkins, said. The earliest confirmed XE case in Britain has a specimen date of Jan. 19 of this year, suggesting it could have been in circulation in the population for several months. It has also been detected beyond the U.K. in Thailand. Surging cases It comes as the U.K. faces a new surge in infections.

The News with Shepard Smith Leading U.S. scientists and physicians worry that the FDA and CDC are moving too fast in approving a fourth round of Covid shots, with little public debate that gives the vaccine makers too big a role in setting the pace with which the doses are distributed across the nation. The top U.S. public health agencies last week endorsed a fourth Covid shot for older adults without holding public meetings, drawing criticism from leading vaccine experts who believe federal health officials haven't provided enough transparency about the reasons for the decision. Cathy Dozal gets her second booster shot against COVID-19 from Vocational nursing student, Patricia Lizardo, at Long Beach City College in Long Beach on Wednesday, March 30, 2022. Brittany Murray | Medianews Group | Getty Images The authorization of a fourth dose for adults age 50 and older comes as the scientific community is divided over whether the data is sufficient to support another round of boosters, and whether authorizing additional shots is a sustainable public health policy, especially since protection against infection simply wears off over time. There is a debate over whether the goal of the vaccines is to prevent severe illness, which they've largely achieved, or infection as well \u2014 a more challenging proposition. The Food and Drug Administration authorized a second booster shot for people age 50 and older last week, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention quickly backed their distribution hours later based on data from Israel, which rolled out fourth doses months ago. Dr. Peter Marks, who heads the FDA office responsible for vaccine safety and efficacy, said shortly after the decision that another round of boosters will likely be needed in the fall. Rapid approval The rapid regulatory clearance of fourth shots for older adults came just weeks after Pfizer and Moderna asked the FDA to permit them. Several FDA and CDC committee members as well as other leading experts said Pfizer and Moderna are playing too large a role in setting the agenda around U.S. vaccine policy by announcing the need for fourth doses and possibly a variant-specific vaccine before the public health agencies have made any recommendations. Moderna CEO Stephane Bancel said during a January interview with Goldman Sachs that fourth doses would be needed in the fall as the protective antibodies from the shots wane over time. Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla told CNBC in early March, before the company filed its request with the FDA, that there's a need for a fourth dose though he said the regulators would ultimately come to their own conclusion. \"\"I just think it's sort of booster mania. I think the companies are frankly acting like public health agencies,\"\" said Dr. Paul Offit, a member of the FDA committee and one of the nation's top vaccine experts. Offit said the CDC, which has the final say on vaccine recommendations, needs to develop a clear national strategy to reduce public confusion about what it means to be fully vaccinated at this stage in the Covid pandemic . Michael Osterholm, a leading epidemiologist, said repeated boosting is not a sustainable public health strategy because of the challenge posed by waning immunity against infection. \"\"We're not gonna be able to boost our way out of this,\"\" said Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota. Call for more transparency The FDA and CDC vaccine advisory panels weigh safety and efficacy data before making recommendations to top federal health officials on the best path forward. Though the recommendations are nonbinding, the meetings provide an open forum where the public can listen to the nation's top health experts debate the pros and cons of vaccine policy, and often even participate by phoning in to voice their views. The FDA's Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee is meeting Wednesday to debate the future of boosters. However, it will not vote on any specific recommendations, according to the FDA. The CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices did not meet before CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky signed off on the fourth shots for older adults last week. \"\"It's just sort of fait accompli,\"\" Offit said. \"\"I feel that we're in a time, this sort of Covid exceptionalism, where we don't do things the way we normally do it, which is that the science precedes the recommendation. Here, it's the other way around,\"\" he said. Offit said that the FDA is effectively asking the public to believe that the data supports a fourth dose by providing sufficient protection against serious illness. He said the American public benefits from hearing an open discussion about vaccine decisions, particularly at a time when many people are not taking advantage of the third dose. Offit is an infectious disease expert at Children's Hospital Philadelphia and a co-inventor of a rotavirus vaccine. VIDEO 1:45 01:45 FDA authorizes fourth Covid vaccine dose for people age 50 and older Squawk on the Street Marks, during a call with reporters last week, said the FDA did not call a committee meeting because the decision was \"\"relatively straightforward.\"\" He said data from Israel suggested a fourth dose can reduce the risk of hospitalization and death in older adults. The CDC, in a statement to CNBC, said the fourth dose was an incremental change that did not need to go before its committee. Dr. William Schaffner, a nonvoting member of ACIP, disagreed that the CDC recommendation was an incremental change. Schaffner said clearing fourth doses for older adults is a big decision that would have benefited from a meeting of outside advisors to provide the public with transparency. \"\"I think to have this decision made in-house behind closed doors without having the transparency of a full debate that a regularly called ACIP meeting would have provided \u2013 I think that's unfortunate,\"\" said Schaffner, an infectious disease expert at Vanderbilt University Medical Center. Dr. James Hildreth, who is attending the FDA committee's Wednesday meeting as a temporary member, noted that the drug regulator wasn't required to call a public meeting before authorizing the shots, and the agency has seasoned experts who can determine if there is evidence to support a new authorization. However, Hildreth said moving forward without a recommendation from outside experts fuels the perception that industry is playing too big a role in the nation's vaccine strategy. \"\"When the FDA makes a decision like that without calling together an outside group of experts, it just adds to the optics of the pharmaceutical companies having an impact on decisions that are being made,\"\" said Hildreth, president of Meharry Medical College in Nashville, Tennessee. Meharry is a clinical trial site for Novavax's vaccine as well as Moderna's shots for younger children. CNBC Health &amp; Science Read CNBC's latest global coverage of the Covid pandemic: FDA authorizes fourth Pfizer Covid vaccine dose for people age 50 and older Omicron BA.2 subvariant will soon dominate in U.S., but Fauci doesn\u2019t expect another surge UnitedHealth to buy LHC Group for $5.4 billion Moderna Covid vaccine for kids under 6 years old was up to 44% effective against omicron infection Omicron's 'stealth' subvariant BA.2 could go 'wild' in Europe before going global, top epidemiologist says FDA advisory committee to discuss future of Covid boosters 'Diminishing returns' While some health experts believe the central purposes of the vaccines is to prevent severe illness, others think it is important to also stop infections from the virus. The protection provided by the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines against infection has declined substantially over time, particularly in the context of omicron, which has numerous mutations that give it an enhanced capability to cause breakthrough infections and mild illness. However, the vaccines are still providing substantial protection against severe illness. \"\"If you've gotten a mild illness after you've been vaccinated, you've won \u2014 that's it. You've been prevented from having serious illness, which is the stated goal of this vaccine,\"\" said Offit, who believes three doses were necessary for the elderly and four for the people with weak immune systems, but is skeptical of the need for additional shots right now. But if the goal is also to prevent infection, that means, at least for now, booster shots are the only available tool to increase antibodies until a longer-lasting vaccine is available. The problem is that the vaccines eventually run into diminishing returns, according John Moore, \u00a0a professor of microbiology and immunology at Weill Cornell Medical College. Moore said a three-dose regimen is fairly standard with vaccines to help boost the immune system to its peak response. A fourth shot, however, begins to hit a ceiling \u2014 at least in terms of protecting younger people against infection. The Israeli Health Ministry and scientists at Sheba Medical Center found that a fourth dose does restore antibodies that waned off after a third dose among health-care workers ages 18 and older, but it provided little protection against infection. Pfizer cited that study, which has not undergone peer-review, among others in its statement on the FDA authorization, focusing on the increased antibodies without highlighting the issues with breakthrough infections. Different age, different needs Dr. Peter Hotez, a vaccine expert at the Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, strongly supports a fourth dose for older adults, pointing to a CDC study from February that found the third shot's effectiveness against hospitalization dropped from 91% to 78% after four months. Pfizer, in its public statements on the fourth dose, cited a separate Israeli study that found a fourth dose reduced mortality by 78% in people ages 60 and over. The study from Ben Gurion University and Clalit Health Services, which has not undergone peer-review, analyzed the medical records of more than 500,000 people. 'We continue to collect and assess all available data and remain in open dialogue with regulators and health authorities to help inform a Covid-19 vaccine strategy as the virus evolves,\"\" Pfizer said in a statement to CNBC. While the Ben Gurion study may point in the direction of a benefit for older adults at the moment, the evidence for boosting younger adults again is scant as the U.S. considers lowering the eligibility for fourth doses sometime later in the year. VIDEO 1:59 01:59 Moderna CEO Stephane Bancel on fourth Covid vaccine dose, BA.2 omicron variant Squawk Box Dr. Gili Regev-Yochay and her team of scientists at Sheba said a fourth dose \"\"may only have marginal benefits\"\" for younger people, according to a letter published in the New England Journal of Medicine. While Pfizer originally filed for adults age 65 and older, Moderna asked the FDA authorize a fourth dose for ages 18 and older. Moore called Moderna's filing \"\"aggressive,\"\" arguing that it didn't distinguish between the needs of the elderly, who may benefit from an additional dose, compared with younger adults where the data is less convincing. Moderna CEO Bancel told CNBC last month that the company wanted to give the FDA flexibility to decide which age group would benefit most from a fourth shot right now. Moderna, in its public statements on its application for a fourth dose, pointed to data from Israel but didn't cite specific studies. Though Hotez supports a fourth dose for older adults, he said the FDA and the CDC have not done an effective job at communicating whether the goal of the vaccines is to prevent severe illness, infection or both, and the vaccines makers have filled that void with statements on data from their clinical trials and lab studies. Hotez and a team of scientists in Texas developed a Covid vaccine, Corbevax, based on traditional protein-based technology that has received authorization in India. Hotez also expressed frustration that the U.S. relies heavily on data from abroad, particularly Israel and the U.K. Offit also questioned why the U.S. is relying on data from countries that are smaller than the U.S. and have different demographic backgrounds. Long-term strategy needed Hildreth said the U.S. should put off additional booster doses as long as the public health situation allows so the nation can more clearly define how it measures protection against the virus and develop a long-term strategy to achieve that end. He said if the public is asked to get boosted every several months, many people will simply stop listening. \"\"We don't know a specific measure we can do to say whether or not a person is truly protected, and whether or that's the same with everybody,\"\" said Hildreth. For example, there's no clear measure of whether a certain level of antibodies is sufficient to protect people, he said. Beyond vaccination with the current vaccines, Pfizer and Moderna are developing shots that target omicron as well as other variants. Dr. Arnold Monto, who is chairing the FDA's committee meeting on booster strategy Wednesday, said public health authorities need to develop a consensus about what goes into the vaccines moving forward. Monto said collaboration between the vaccine makers and the government is crucial, but industry has started playing a larger public role in decisions about about what kind of vaccines should be developed to target specific Covid variants. \"\"Industry has a double-headed goal. They are trying to do public good like we all are. They also have stockholders, and we need to be sure that the public health good is kept mind,\"\" Monto said.

We are bullish on both EV and EUV,\"\" Steve Majoros, vice president of Chevrolet marketing, told media Wednesday. The automaker restarted production and shipments of the Bolt EV and a larger \"\"EUV\"\" version this week. Production of the vehicles at a plant in Michigan had largely been down since August, when the automaker recalled every Bolt that had been produced at the factory since 2016. The recall followed the Detroit automaker determining two \"\"rare manufacturing defects\"\" in the lithium-ion battery cells of the vehicle's battery pack could cause a fire. GM is aware of 19 vehicle fires related to the problem, a spokesman said. The fires and recall were a major setback for the automaker in terms of EV sales and its reputation, despite its battery supplier, an LG company, taking blame for the issues. The Vermont State Police released this photo of the 2019 Chevrolet Bolt EV that caught fire on July 1, 2021 in the driveway of state Rep. Timothy Briglin, a Democrat. Vermont State Police GM will attempt to relaunch the Bolt models to Americans starting Thursday with a new national television campaign for the cars, Majoros said. Ads shown to media do not mention the recall or fires. \"\"We think we have a lot of interest and awareness for this,\"\" he said, adding the advertising will have a \"\"big presence\"\" during the opening day games of Major League Baseball. \"\"I think it's just going to continue with our advertising efforts.\"\" Majoros, calling it an \"\"arm's race,\"\" said the record Bolt sales expectations are largely due to increased interest overall in EVs, not necessarily connected to record gas prices nationally this year. The Bolt EV went on sale in December 2016, while the Bolt EUV went on sale last year shortly before all the vehicles were recalled. The Bolt nameplates achieved record sales of nearly 25,000 units last year, topping sales of the Bolt EV of more than 23,000 in 2017.
